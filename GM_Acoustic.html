Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up, I noticed I was late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way upstairs and had a smoke and somebody spoke and I went into a dream<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhh..<br>
<br>
I read the news today oh boy, four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire<br>
And though the holes were rather small they had to count them all<br>
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall<br>
I'd love to turn you on<br>

In those days we were lions. In those days we were kings.<br>
It's not one thing or the other. It's all things all at once.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I'll love you better than him x 4 + (3 Measures)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ohhh x 2<br>
<br>
These wings ain't for flying. These wings are just for show.<br>
It's years since I've been flying. I am down to the earth.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I'll love you better than him x 4<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ohhh x 4<br>

I can see why you think you belong to me.<br>
I never tried to make you think or let you see one thing for yourself.<br>
But now you're off with someone else and I'm alone.<br>
You see I thought that I could keep you for my own.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amie, what you wanna do?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that I could stay with you, for a while maybe longer if I do<br>
<br>
Don't you think the time is right for us to find.<br>
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time and can you see<br>
Which way we should turn together or alone?<br>
I can never see what's right or what is wrong<br>
<br>
Chorus / Harmonica D<br>
<br>
Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way.<br>
And all the things you're fighting for just faded into gray and can you see,<br>
that I don't know if it's you or if it's me?<br>
If it's one of us, I'm sure we both will see<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>

I keep, fallin in and out of love with you... fallin..<br>
Don't know what I'm gonna do, I keep, fallin in and out of love with you.<br>

She gives me everything and tenderly<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A love like ours could never die<br>

When you grab a hold of me, tell me I will never be set free<br>
But I'm a parasite creep and crawl I step into the night<br>
Two pints of booze tell me are you a bad fish too?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain't got no money to spend, I know the night will never end.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord knows I'm weak, won't somebody get me off this reef?<br>
<br>
Baby you're a big blue whale, grab the reef when all duck diving fails<br>
I swim, but I wish I never learned the water's too polluted with germs<br>
I dive deep when it's ten feet over head grab the reef from underneath my bed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain't got not quarrels with God, ain't got no time to grow old.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord knows I'm weak, won't some body get me off this reef?<br>

When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings<br>

Headin' out to San Francisco for the labor day weekend show<br>
I got my hush puppies on I guess I never was meant for glitter rock'n roll<br>
And honey I didn't know that I'd be missing you so<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come Monday, it'll be all right Come Monday, I'll be holding you tight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent four lonely days in a brown LA haze and I just want you back by my side<br>

Yes its been quite a summer rent a cars and west bound trains<br>
And now your off on vacation something you tried to explain<br>
And darling since I love you so that's the reason I just let you go<br>

I hope you're enjoying the scenery I know that it's pretty up there<br>

California has worn me quite thin I just can't wait till I see you again<br>

If there's one thing in my life that's missing it's the time that I spend alone<br>
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water<br>
There's lots of those friendly people they're showing me ways to go<br>
But I never want to lose their inspiration<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time for cool change, I know that it's time for a cool change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now that my life is so prearranged..<br>
<br>
Well I was born in the sign of water and it's there that I feel my best<br>
The albatross and the whales they are my brothers<br>
It's kind of a special feeling when you're out on the sea alone<br>
Staring at the full moon like a lover<br>
<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice.<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are?<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>
<br>
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>
And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them<br>
Ever since I was little it looked like fun<br>
And it's no coincidence I've come and I can die when I'm done<br>

Conceived in love, sun is gonna shine above.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And everything will bring a chain of love.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell me everything is gonna be alright.<br>
<br>
Seems as though a month ago I beta chi<br>

Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup<br>

Don't get too lost in all I say<br>

On the first part of the journey I was lookin at all the life<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz and the sky with no clouds<br>
The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it felt good to be out of the rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the desert you can remember your name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la<br>
<br>
After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground and the perfect disguise above<br>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

I am a man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble all my days<br>
I bid farewell to old Kentucky the place where I was born and raised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he was born and raised<br>

For six long years I've been in trouble no pleasure here on Earth I found<br>
For in this world I'm bound to ramble I have no friends to help me now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no friends to help him now<br>

It's fare-thee-well my old true lover I never expect to see you again<br>

You can bury me in some deep valley for many years where I may lay<br>

We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty if your cup is full may it be again.<br>
Let it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of men.<br>
There is a road, no simple highway between the dawn and the dark of night.<br>

Got out of town on a boat goin to southern islands sailing a reach before a followin sea<br>
She was makin for the trades on the outside and the downhill run to Papeete Bay<br>
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas we got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way<br>
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you but on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about how many times I have fallen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits are using me, larger voices callin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been around the world lookin' for that woman, girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows love can endure and you know it will and you know it will<br>
<br>
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time you understand now why you came this way<br>
'Cause the truth you might be runnin from is so small but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day<br>
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dyin and my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain<br>
I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin she is all that I have left and music is her name<br>
<br>

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

So, so you think you can tell, heaven from hell, blue skies from pain<br>
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil<br>
Do you think you can tell?<br>
<br>
Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change<br>
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage<br>
<br>
How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year<br>
Running over the same old ground what have we found<br>
the same old fears. Wish you were here<br>

See the stone set in your eyes<br>
See the thorn twist in your side, I wait for you<br>
<br>
Sleight of hand and twist of fate<br>
On a bed of nails she makes me wait, and I wait without you<br>
With or without you<br>
<br>
Through the storm we reach the shore<br>
You give it all but I want more, and I'm waiting for you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With or without you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't live with or without you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you give yourself away...<br>
<br>
My hands are tied, my body bruised, she's got me with<br>
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you give yourself away<br>

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you<br>
By now you should've somehow realised what you gotta do<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
<br>
Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out<br>
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the roads we have to walk are winding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the lights that lead us there are blinding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things that I would Like to say to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't know how<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after all you're my wonderwall<br>

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you<br>
By now you should've somehow realised what you're not to do<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
