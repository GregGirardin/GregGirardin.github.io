Jessie is a friend yeah I know, he's been a good friend of mine<br>
But lately something's changed, it ain't hard to define<br>
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's watchin him with those eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's lovin him with that body, I just know it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he's holdin her in his arms, late late at night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Y'know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I find a woman like that?<br>
<br>
I'll play along with the charade<br>
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change<br>
Y'know I feel so dirty when they start talkin cute<br>
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm lookin in the mirror all the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondrin what she don't see in me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah I've been funny I've been cool with the lines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?<br>

Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?<br>

Tell me do you think it'd be all right, if I could just crash here tonight<br>
You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go<br>
And you know it might not be that bad, you were the best I'd ever had<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is gone but something might be found to take its place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey jealousy..<br>
<br>
And you can trust me not to think and not to sleep around<br>
If you don't expect too much from me you might not be let down<br>
Cause all I really want is to be with you feeling like I matter too<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you<br>

When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are<br>
Or what we're doin', I'm with you that's all that matters<br>
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing<br>
I wish I could sing it to you, woh oh...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wo...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly I'm silent, silent, never think of bad words to say<br>
<br>
When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings<br>
The color of chills, all over my body<br>
And when I feel them I quickly try to decide which one<br>
I should try to put into words, oh&nbsp;&nbsp;try to put into words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wo ..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly I'm silent.. silent<br>
<br>
Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever<br>
Only the beginning, only just the start.<br>
Got to get you into my life.<br>

Woo-hoo,woo-hoo<br>
<br>
Well my heart knows me better than I know myself so I'm gonna let it do all the talking.<br>
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere with a big black horse and a cherry tree.<br>
I felt a little fear upon my back I said "Don't look back, just keep on walking.<br>
When the big black horse said, "Look this way" He said, "Hey there baby, will you marry me?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I said no... I said, no, no, you're not the one for me<br>
<br>
And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours, so I stopped it dead for a beat or two.<br>
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it, and it won't forgive me after all these years<br>
So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere with a big black horse and a cherry tree.<br>
Now it won't come back, cause it's oh so happy and now I've got a hole for the world to see<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice.<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are?<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>
<br>
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>
And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them<br>
Ever since I was little it looked like fun<br>
And it's no coincidence I've come and I can die when I'm done<br>

Travelling in a fried-out kombi<br>
On a hippy trail, head full of zombie<br>
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous<br>
She took me in and gave me breakfast, and she said<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you come from a land down under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where women glow, and men plunder?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You better run, you better take cover<br>

Buying bread from a man in Brussels, he was<br>
Six foot four and full of muscles<br>
I said: do you speak-a my language?<br>
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich, and he said<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from a land down under<br>

Don't get too lost in all I say<br>

On the first part of the journey I was lookin at all the life<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz and the sky with no clouds<br>
The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it felt good to be out of the rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the desert you can remember your name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la<br>
<br>
After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground and the perfect disguise above<br>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>

But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>

I never meant to cause you any sorrow<br>
I never meant to cause you any pain<br>
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing<br>
I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Purple rain, purple rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I only wanted to see you bathing in the purple rain<br>
<br>
I never wanted to be your weekend lover<br>
I only wanted to be some kind of friend<br>
Baby, I could never steal you from another<br>
It's such a shame our friendship had to end<br>
<br>
Honey I know times are changing<br>
It's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too<br>
You say you want a leader but you can't seem to make up your mind<br>
I think you better close it and let me guide you to the purple rain<br>

D (G D) [G A / A D]<br>
<br>
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

<br>
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha<br>
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song<br>
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before<br>
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do<br>
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' there to do<br>
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I am on the road again there I am on the stage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I go playin' star again there I go turn the page<br>
<br>
Well you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road<br>
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold<br>
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode<br>
Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can<br>
All the same old cliches, "Is it woman, is it man?"<br>
And you always seem outnumbered so you don't dare make a stand<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away<br>
Every ounce of energy you try to give away<br>
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play<br>
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed<br>
With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head<br>
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said<br>
