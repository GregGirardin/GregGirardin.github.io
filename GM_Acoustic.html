Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up, I noticed I was late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way upstairs and had a smoke and somebody spoke and I went into a dream<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that I could stay with you, for a while maybe longer if I do<br>

Don't you think the time is right for us to find.<br>

There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that make me crazy? Probably<br>

And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>

Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>

You know I'm a dreamer, but my heart's of gold.<br>
I had to run away high, so I wouldn't come home low.<br>
Just when things went right, it doesn't mean they're always wrong.<br>
Just take this song and you'll never feel left all alone.<br>
Take me to your heart, feel me in your bones.<br>
Just one more night, and I'm coming off this long and winding road.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm on my way, home sweet home, tonight..<br>
<br>
You know that I've seen, too many romantic dreams,<br>
up in the lights, falling on the silver screen.<br>
My heart's like an open book, for the whole world to read,<br>
Sometimes nothing, keeps me together at the seams.<br>

<br>
On the first part of the journey I was lookin at all the life<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz and the sky with no clouds<br>
The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it felt good to be out of the rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the desert you can remember your name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la<br>
<br>
After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground and the perfect disguise above<br>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

<br>
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

There's a killer on the road his brain is squirmin' like a toad<br>
Take a long holiday let your children play<br>
If you give this man a ride sweet family will die<br>
Killer on the road, yeah<br>
<br>
Girl, you gotta love your man..<br>
Take him by the hand make him understand<br>
The world on you depends our life will never end<br>
Gotta love your man, yeah<br>

If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung.<br>
Would you hear my voice come through the music would you hold it near as it were your own.<br>
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken perhaps they're better left unsung.<br>
I don't know, don't really care let there be songs to fill the air.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripple in still water when there is no pebble tossed nor wind to blow<br>
<br>
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty if your cup is full may it be again.<br>
Let it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of men.<br>
There is a road, no simple highway between the dawn and the dark of night.<br>
And if you go no one may follow that path is for your steps alone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripple in still water...<br>
<br>
You who choose to lead must follow but if you fall you fall alone.<br>
If you should stand then who's to guide you if I knew the way I would take you home.<br>

Are you goin to Scarborough Fair? Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme<br>
Remember me to one who lives there she once was a true love of mine<br>
<br>
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt - On the side of a hill in the deep forest green<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground<br>
Without no seams nor needlework - Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine - Sleeps unaware of the clarion call<br>
<br>
Tell her to find me an acre of land - On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Washes the grave with silvery tears<br>
Between the salt water and the sea strands - A soldier cleans and polishes a gun<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>
<br>
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather - War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Generals order their soldiers to kill<br>
And gather it all in a bunch of heather - And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>

We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.<br>
City lights and business nights<br>
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;No place to be ending but somewhere to start.<br>

Face to face, each classic case.<br>
We shadow box and double cross, yet need the chase.<br>

Got out of town on a boat goin to southern islands sailing a reach before a followin sea<br>
She was makin for the trades on the outside and the downhill run to Papeete Bay<br>
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas we got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way<br>
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you but on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about how many times I have fallen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits are using me, larger voices callin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been around the world lookin' for that woman, girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows love can endure and you know it will and you know it will<br>
<br>
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time you understand now why you came this way<br>
'Cause the truth you might be runnin from is so small but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day<br>
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dyin and my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain<br>
I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin she is all that I have left and music is her name<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
So we cheated and we lied and we tested and we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do<br>
You will survive being bested but somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you<br>

<br>
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>
