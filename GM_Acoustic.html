I'll play along with the charade<br>
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change<br>
Y'know I feel so dirty when they start talkin' cute<br>
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is prob'ly moot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's watchin...<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondrin' what she don't see in me<br>

Tell me do you think it'd be all right, if I could just crash here tonight<br>
You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go<br>
And you know it might not be that bad, you were the best I'd ever had<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is gone but something might be found to take its place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey jealousy..<br>
<br>
And you can trust me not to think and not to sleep around<br>
If you don't expect too much from me you might not be let down<br>
Cause all I really want is to be with you feeling like I matter too<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you<br>

She says her love for me could never die<br>
But that'll change if she'd ever find out about you and I<br>
O, but her love is cold it wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cuz<br>
When it gets too much I need to feel your touch<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm gonna run to you, I'm gonna run to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cuz when the feeling's right I'm gonna run all night<br>

She's got a heart of gold she'd never let me down<br>
But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me coming round<br>

Hey..<br>
<br>
Won't you come see about me? I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby<br>
Tell me your troubles and doubts giving me everything inside and out and<br>
Love's strange so real in the dark think of the tender things that we were working on<br>
Slow change may pull us apart when the light gets into your heart, baby<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you forget about me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you stand above me, look my way, never love me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you recognize me, call my name or walk on by..<br>
<br>
Intro<br>
<br>
Don't you try to pretend it's my feeling we'll win in the end<br>
I won't harm you or touch your defenses vanity and security<br>
Don't you forget about me I'll be alone dancing you know it baby<br>
Going to take you apart I'll put us back together at heart baby<br>
<br>
 Don't you forget about me x 2<br>
 As you walk on by will you call my name? x 2<br>
 When you walk away Or will you walk away?<br>
 Will you walk on by? Come on call my name<br>
 Will you all my name? I say...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;La..<br>

<button class='accordion'>5. Far Behind</button>
<div class='panel'>
Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway<br>
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway<br>
And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble as you falter down to the ground<br>
And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying oh you were flying oh so high<br>
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer yeah they hear you calling home<br>
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us But you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad but I did it anyway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had but you couldn't share the pain<br>
<br>
No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown won't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind as you trip the final line<br>
And that cold day when you lost control shame you left my life so soon you should have told me but you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>

I said times have changed your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground they watch you suffer<br>
Yeah, they hold you down gold you down now maybe oh oh, maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but you left me far behind<br>

She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>

Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>

God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are<br>
Or what we're doin', I'm with you that's all that matters<br>
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing<br>
I wish I could sing it to you, woh oh...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wo...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly I'm silent, silent, never think of bad words to say<br>

When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings<br>
The color of chills, all over my body<br>
And when I feel them I quickly try to decide which one<br>
I should try to put into words, oh&nbsp;&nbsp;try to put into words<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice.<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are?<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>
<br>
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>
And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them<br>
Ever since I was little it looked like fun<br>
And it's no coincidence I've come and I can die when I'm done<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies<br>
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly a girl with kaleidoscope eyes<br>
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green towering over your head<br>
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone<br>

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies<br>

Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone<br>

<button class='accordion'>12. One Thing Leads To Another</button>
<div class='panel'>
The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Break *<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another..<br>
<br>
Then it's easy to believe, somebody's been lying to me<br>
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>

<div class='panel'>
D (G D) [G A / A D]<br>
<br>
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty the sound of their voice fades with the light<br>
I think about the loveless fascination under the Milky Way tonight<br>

Lower the curtains down on Memphis lower the curtains down alright<br>
I've got no time for private consultation under the Milky Way tonight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish I knew what you were looking for<br>
