I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah. Me and my baby in '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of '69, yeah.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's lovin him with that body, I just know it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Y'know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I find a woman like that?<br>

There doesn't seem to be a reason to change<br>
Y'know I feel so dirty when they start talkin cute<br>
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot<br>

Dancin in the aisles and singin' out loud<br>

It's all the same only the names will change<br>
And ev'ry day it seems we're wasting away<br>
Another place where the faces are so cold<br>
I'd drive all night just to get back home<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm wanted dead or alive, wanted dead or alive<br>
<br>
Sometimes I sleep sometimes is not for days<br>
and people I meet always go their separate ways<br>
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink<br>
And times when all you do is think<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
And I walk these streets a loaded six string on my back<br>
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back<br>
I been ev'ry where still I'm standig tall<br>
I've seen a milion faces and I've rock them all<br>

Tell me do you think it'd be all right, if I could just crash here tonight<br>
You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go<br>
And you know it might not be that bad, you were the best I'd ever had<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is gone but something might be found to take its place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey jealousy..<br>
<br>
And you can trust me not to think and not to sleep around<br>
If you don't expect too much from me you might not be let down<br>
Cause all I really want is to be with you feeling like I matter too<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you<br>

I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind<br>
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
And I feel there is nothing I can do, oh yeah<br>
<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you<br>
I really don't mind what happens now and then<br>
As long as you'll be my friend at the end<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'm alive and well will you be there a holding my hand?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kryptonite<br>

You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep<br>
You took for granted all the times I never let you down<br>
You stumbled in and bumped your head if not for me then you'd be dead<br>
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground<br>

Get yourself cooler lay yourself low<br>
Coincidental murder with nothing to show<br>
With the judge constipation will go to his head<br>
And his wife's aggravation, you soon end up dead<br>

 It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend x 2<br>

Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun<br>
No smooth face lawyer to getcha undone<br>
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town<br>
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around<br>

I said 'hey what is this?' Now baby maybe, maybe she's in need of a kiss.<br>
I said 'hey, what's your name baby? Maybe we can see things the same'<br>
Now don't you wait or hesitate, let's move before they raise the parking rate, oh!<br>

On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha<br>
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song<br>
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before<br>
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do<br>
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' there to do<br>
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I am on the road again there I am on the stage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I go playin' star again there I go turn the page<br>
<br>
Well you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road<br>
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold<br>
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode<br>
Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can<br>
All the same old cliches, "Is it woman, is it man?"<br>
And you always seem outnumbered so you don't dare make a stand<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away<br>
Every ounce of energy you try to give away<br>
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play<br>
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed<br>
With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head<br>
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>

Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday.<br>

When you were here before couldn't look you in the eye<br>
You're just like an angel your skin makes me cry<br>
You float like a feather in a beautiful world<br>
I wish I was special you're so fuckin' special<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hell am I doin' here? I don't belong here<br>
<br>
I don't care if it hurts I wanna have control<br>
I want a perfect body I want a perfect soul<br>
I want you to notice when I'm not around<br>
So fuckin' special I wish I was special<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

Whatever makes you happy whatever you want<br>
You're so fuckin' special I wish I was special<br>

<button class='accordion'>8. Play That Funky Music</button>
<div class='panel'>
Hey, do it now<br>
<br>
Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

Late at night I close my eyes and think of how things could have been<br>
And when I look back I remember some words you had said to me<br>
It's better to have lost at love then never to have loved at all<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't forget you baby, even though I [could | should]<br>
<br>
Sometimes in my head I can still see pictures of you<br>
And I laugh to myself when I think of all those crazy things that we used to do<br>
Although miles come between us, just between you and me<br>

We both lie silently still in the dead of the night<br>
Although we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside<br>
Was it something I said or something I did?<br>
Did my words not come out right?<br>
Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried<br>
But I guess that's why they say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Every rose has its thorn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like every night has its dawn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Every rose has its thorn, yeah, it does<br>
<br>
I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio<br>
Hear the DJ say, "Love's a game of easy come and easy go"<br>
But I wonder, does he know? Has he ever felt like this?<br>
And I know that you'd be here right now<br>
If I could have let you know somehow, I guess<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it's been a while now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still feel so much pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the scar, that scar remains<br>
<br>
I know I could have saved a love that night if I'd known what to say<br>
Instead of making love we both made our separate ways<br>
And now I hear you found somebody new and that I never meant that much to you<br>
To hear that tears me up inside<br>
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess<br>

Maybe, it's not too late, to learn how to love, and forget how to hate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds not healing life's a bitter shame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm goin off the rails on a crazy train<br>

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules<br>
One person conditioned to rule and control, the media sells it and you live the role<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds still screaming driving me insane...<br>

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway<br>
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway<br>
And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble as you falter down to the ground<br>
And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying oh you were flying oh so high<br>
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer yeah they hear you calling home<br>
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us But you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad but I did it anyway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had but you couldn't share the pain<br>
<br>
No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown won't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind as you trip the final line<br>
And that cold day when you lost control shame you left my life so soon you should have told me but you left me far behind<br>
<br>

I said times have changed your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground they watch you suffer<br>

You got a fast car I want a ticket to anywhere<br>
Maybe we make a deal, maybe together we can get somewhere<br>
Any place is better, starting from zero, got nothing to lose<br>
Maybe we'll make something, me, myself, I got nothing to prove<br>
<br>
You got a fast car I got a plan to get us outta here<br>
I been working at the convenience store managed to save just a little bit of money<br>
Won't have to drive too far, just across the border and into the city<br>
You and I can both get jobs, finally see what it means to be living<br>
<br>
See, my old man's got a problem, he lives with a bottle, that's the way it is<br>
He says his body's too old for workin, his body's too young to look like his<br>
When mama went off and left him she wanted more from life than he could give<br>
I said, "Somebody's gotta take care of him", I quit school and that's what I did<br>
<br>
You got a fast car is it fast enough so you can fly away?<br>
You gotta make a decision leave tonight or live and die this way<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I had a feeling that I belonged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a feeling I could be someone be someone<br>
<br>
You got a fast car we go cruisin', entertain ourselves<br>
You still ain't got a job and I work in a market as a checkout girl<br>
I know things will get better you'll find work and I'll get promoted<br>
And we'll move out of the shelter, buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
You got a fast car I got a job that pays all our bills<br>
You stay out drinkin late at the bar see more of your friends than you do of your kids<br>
I'd always hoped for better thought maybe together, you and me'd find it<br>
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere so take your fast car and keep on drivin<br>
<br>
You got a fast car is it fast enough so you can fly away?<br>
You gotta make a decision leave tonight or live and die this way<br>
