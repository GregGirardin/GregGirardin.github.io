To wish me greetings, once again<br>
<br>
Choirs will be singing (ooh) Silent Night<br>
Christmas carols (ooh) by candlelight<br>
Please come home for Christmas, please come home for Christmas<br>
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends and relations send salutations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure as the stars shine above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is Christmas, yeah Christmas my dear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of year to be with the ones you love<br>
<br>
So won't you tell me (ooh) you'll never more roam<br>
Christmas and New Year's (ooh) will find you home<br>
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain<br>
And I'll be happy happy once again<br>

Key: Cm<br>
<br>
I don't care if Monday's blue, Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too<br>
Thursday I don't care about you it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
Monday you can fall apart, Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart<br>
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start, it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday wait, and Sunday always comes too late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Friday never hesitate<br>
<br>
I don't care if Monday's black, Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack<br>
Thursday never looking back it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Monday you can hold your head Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed<br>
Or Thursday watch the walls instead It's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday wait..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed up to the eyes it's a wonderful surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see your shoes and your spirits rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as sleek as a shriek spinning 'round and 'round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always take a big bite it's such a gorgeous sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see you eat in the middle of the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can never get enough, enough of this stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Friday, I'm in love<br>

<div class='panel'>
Lay where you're laying, don't make a sound<br>
I know they're watching, they're watching<br>
All the commotion, the kiddie-like play<br>
It has people talking, talking<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>
<br>
The dark of the alley, the breaking of day<br>
Head while I'm driving, I'm driving<br>
Soft lips are open, them knuckles are pale<br>
Feels like you're dying, you're dying<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumed, with what's just transpired<br>
<br>
Hot as a fever, rattle of bones<br>
I could just taste it, taste it<br>
If this not forever, if this just tonight<br>
Oh we're still the greatest, the greatest<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumed, with what's just transpired<br>

<button class='accordion'>5. I Will Follow</button>
<div class='panel'>
I was on the outside when you said, you said you needed me<br>
I was looking at myself, I was blind, I could not see<br>
<br>
A boy tries hard to be a man his mother takes him by his hand<br>
If he stops to think he starts to cry, oh, why?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you walk away, walk away walk away, walk away, I will follow x 2<br>
<br>
I was on the inside when they pulled the four walls down<br>
I was looking through the window, I was lost, I am found<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eyes make a circle, I see you when I go in there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eyes..<br>

<br>
Well, she was an American girl raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>
And if she had to die tryin she had one little promise she was gonna keep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus&nbsp;&nbsp;/ Break / Solo<br>

<button class='accordion'>7. Devil Inside</button>
<div class='panel'>
Here come the woman with the look in her eye<br>
Raised on leather with flesh on her mind<br>
Words as weapons sharper than knives<br>
Makes you wonder how the other half die<br>
How the other half die<br>
Makes you wonder, wonder, wonder<br>
<br>
Here come the man with the look in his eye<br>
Fed on nothing but full of pride<br>
Look at them go, look at them kick<br>
Makes you wonder how the other half live<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil inside the devil inside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Every single one of us the devil inside (x 2)<br>
<br>
Here come the world with the look in its eye<br>
Future uncertain but certainly slight<br>
Look at the faces listen to the bells<br>
It's hard to believe we need a place called hell<br>
A place called hell<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

You start a conversation you can't even finish it<br>
You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything<br>
When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed<br>
Say something once, why say it again?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ce que j'ai fais ce soir la<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ce qu' elle a dit ce soir la<br>

We are vain and we are blind<br>
I hate people when they're not polite<br>

Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall<br>
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin glass<br>
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you believe in things that you don't understand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way<br>
<br>
Very superstitious, wash your face and hands<br>
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can<br>
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong<br>
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
Very superstitious, nothin' more to say<br>
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way<br>
Thirteen months old baby, broke the lookin' glass<br>
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

Mother told me, yes, she told me That I'd meet girls like you<br>
She also told me, "Stay away You'll never know what you'll catch"<br>
Just the other day I heard Of a soldier's falling off<br>
Some Indonesian junk That's going 'round<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mommy's alright daddy's alright. They just seem a little weird<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrender Surrender, but don't give yourself away<br>

Father says, "Your mother's right she's really up on things<br>
Before we married, Mommy served in the WACS in the Philippines"<br>
Now, I had heard the WACs recruited Old maids for the war<br>
But mommy isn't one of those I've known her all these years<br>

Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year?<br>
Every time I got to thinking where'd they disappear?<br>
But when I woke up, Mom and Dad are rolling on the couch<br>
Rolling numbers, rock and rollin' got my KISS records out<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus (C Am G F)<br>
<br>
Away.. (C F C G)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrender, surrender (Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't give yourself away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrender, surrender (Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't give yourself away<br>
