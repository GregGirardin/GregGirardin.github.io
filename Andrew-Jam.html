&nbsp;&nbsp;I stumble every time you do it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain't never gonna get used to it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging on a garden rose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Untamed, the way that my love grows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Lord, I didn't see it coming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arcadia's got me running<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just trying not to lose my breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cause hell, I'm gonna take that step<br>
<br>
And though my pride has gone<br>
Way down the line<br>
I'm just fine<br>
<br>
If my luck is all that I have today<br>
Well, it's no wonder that you found me<br>
Buried underneath my weight<br>
Well, wood stilts and little red pills<br>
May be all that hold me up<br>
But you pulled the blinds<br>
In this room of mine<br>
Just a little bit brighter since you came<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
Seep up all the light<br>
From the bottom of the spine<br>
Don't fret, don't hang your head<br>
'Cause I'm just fine<br>
<br>
One day, all that I have to give<br>
Well, it will be sitting at your doorstep<br>
Waiting just to come on in<br>
Well, cold rooms and burning flumes<br>
They have left me<br>
Just a little bit lesser than I am<br>
Than I am, than I am going to be<br>

Seep up all the light<br>

Riff x 2<br>
<br>
Waiting on a Sunday afternoon<br>
For what I read between the lines, your lies<br>
<br>
Feelin' like a hand in rusted shame<br>
So do you laugh at those who cry? Reply?<br>
<br>
Riff x 1<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leavin' on a southern train only yesterday you lied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Promises of what I seemed to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only watched the time go by all of these things you said to me<br>
<br>
Riff x 2<br>
<br>
Breathin' is the hardest thing to do<br>
With all I've said and all that's dead for you, you lied, Good bye<br>

<br>
My shadow side so amplified<br>
Keeps coming back dissatisfied<br>
Elementary son but it's so<br>
My love affair with everywhere<br>
Was innocent why do you care?<br>
Someone start the car, time to go<br>
<br>
You're the best I know<br>
<br>
My sunny side has up and died<br>
I'm betting that when we collide<br>
The universe will shift into a low<br>
The travesties that we have seen<br>
Are treating me like Benzedrine<br>
Automatic laughter from a pro<br>
<br>
My what a good day for a walk outside<br>
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby<br>
God knows that I really tried<br>
My what a good day for a take out bride<br>
I'd like to say we did it for the better of<br>
<br>
I saw you there so unaware<br>
Those hummingbirds all in your hair<br>
Elementary son but it's so<br>
The disrepair of Norma Jean<br>
Could not compare to your routine<br>
Balarama beauty going toe to toe<br>
<br>
My what a good day for a let it slide<br>
I'd like to say we did it for the better of<br>
<br>
I thought about it<br>
And I brought it out<br>
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt<br>
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout<br>
The mother, the father, the daughter<br>
<br>
Right on the verge, just one more dose<br>
I'm travelling from coast to coast<br>
My theory isn't perfect but it's close<br>
I'm almost there, why should I care?<br>
My heart is hurting when I share<br>
Someone open up, let it show<br>
<br>
My what a good day for a walk outside<br>
I'd like to think we did it for the better of<br>
<br>
I thought about it and I brought it out<br>
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt<br>
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout<br>
The mother, the father, the daughter<br>
<br>
Oh you don't form in the wet sand<br>
You don't form at all<br>
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand<br>
I do<br>
Yeah<br>

You don't form in the wet sand<br>
You don't form at all<br>

You're tellin' me this town ain't got no heart<br>
Well, well, well, you can never tell<br>

Maybe that's cause it's midnight<br>
In the dark of the moon besides<br>

Maybe the dark is from your eyes<br>
Maybe the dark is from your eyes<br>
Maybe the dark is from your eyes<br>

You think you've seen this town clear through<br>

Nothin' here that could interest you<br>
Well, well, well, you can never tell<br>
It's not because you missed out<br>

When it crackled like a thundercloud<br>

Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart<br>
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart<br>
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart<br>

But I'm down to one last breath<br>
And with it, let me say<br>
Let me say<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold me now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe six feet ain't so far down<br>

I'm looking down, now that it's over<br>
Reflecting on all of my mistakes<br>
I thought I found the road to somewhere<br>
Somewhere in His grace<br>

I cried out, "Heaven, save me"<br>

Hard to cross a heart that beats its best<br>

Take a good hard look for the very last time<br>
The very last one in a very long line<br>
Only took a second to say goodbye<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bet your life there's something killing you<br>
<br>
It's a shame we have to die, my dear<br>
No one's getting out of here alive<br>
This time<br>
<br>
What a way to go, but have no fear<br>
No one's getting out of here alive<br>
This time<br>
<br>
It's a shame we have to disappear<br>
No one's getting out of here alive<br>
This time, this time, this time<br>
