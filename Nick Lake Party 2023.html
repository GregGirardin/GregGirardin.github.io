<br>
I don't care if Monday's blue, Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too<br>
Thursday I don't care about you it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
Monday you can fall apart, Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart<br>
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start, it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday wait, and Sunday always comes too late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Friday never hesitate<br>
<br>
I don't care if Monday's black, Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack<br>
Thursday never looking back it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Monday you can hold your head Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed<br>
Or Thursday watch the walls instead It's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday wait..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed up to the eyes it's a wonderful surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see your shoes and your spirits rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as sleek as a shriek spinning 'round and 'round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always take a big bite it's such a gorgeous sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see you eat in the middle of the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can never get enough, enough of this stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Friday, I'm in love<br>

<br>
Well, she was an American girl raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>
And if she had to die tryin she had one little promise she was gonna keep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

<button class='accordion'>4. I Will Follow</button>
<div class='panel'>
I was on the outside when you said, you said you needed me<br>
I was looking at myself, I was blind, I could not see<br>
<br>
A boy tries hard to be a man his mother takes him by his hand<br>
If he stops to think he starts to cry, oh, why?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you walk away, walk away walk away, walk away, I will follow x 2<br>
<br>
I was on the inside when they pulled the four walls down<br>
I was looking through the window, I was lost, I am found<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eyes make a circle, I see you when I go in there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eyes..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will follow<br>
<br>

<button class='accordion'>5. One Thing Leads To Another</button>
<div class='panel'>
The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Break * (vocal comes in near the end of the break)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing, one thing leads to another..<br>
<br>
Then it's easy to believe, somebody's been lying to me<br>
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>

<br>
I cant seem to face up to the facts<br>
I'm tense and nervous and I cant relax<br>
I cant sleep cause my beds on fire<br>
Don't touch me I'm a real live wire<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Psycho killer qu'est que c'est fa fa.. far better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Run run... away.. oh yeah..<br>
<br>
You start a conversation you can't even finish it<br>
You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything<br>
When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed<br>
Say something once, why say it again?<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ce que j'ai fais ce soir la<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ce qu' elle a dit ce soir la<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Realisant mon espoir je me lance vers la gloire okay<br>
<br>
We are vain and we are blind<br>
I hate people when they're not polite<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Alternate V2<br>
I passed out hours ago<br>
I'm sadder than you'll ever know<br>
I close my eyes on this sunny day<br>
Say something once, why say it again?<br>

Let's dance for fear tonight is all<br>
Let's sway you could look into my eyes<br>
Let's sway under the moonlight, this serious moonlight<br>

Let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues<br>
Let's sway under the moonlight, this serious moonlight<br>

Tell me something I don't understand<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>

Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>

We had broken up for good just an hour before ah-ah-ah..<br>
Now I'm staring at the bodies as they dance across the floor<br>
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music took you down<br>
It was the same old song with a melancholy sound<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't write em like that anymore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They just don't write em like that anymore<br>
<br>
We'd been living together for a million years<br>
But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres<br>
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know<br>
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancin so slow<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't write em like that anymore x 2<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh..<br>
<br>
Hmm, now I wind up staring at an empty glass<br>
Cause it's so easy to say that you'll forget your past<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus x 2<br>

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep you've been starring in my dreams Lord I miss you child<br>
I've been waiting in the hall been waiting on your call when the phone rings<br>
It's just some friends of mine that say: "Hey, what's the matter man?<br>
We're gonna come around at twelve with some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you.<br>
We're gonna bring a case of wine. Hey, let's go mess and fool around you know, like we used to."<br>

Hey, do it now<br>
<br>
Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>
