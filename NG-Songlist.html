Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?<br>
I didn't mean to call you that<br>
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me please tell me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please tell me why my car is in the front yard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm sleeping with my clothes on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I came in through the window last night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you're gone, gone<br>
<br>
It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy<br>
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me<br>
The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette still burning<br>

You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go<br>

If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone<br>

And you can trust me not to think and not to sleep around<br>

Playin all the bars, sleepin' in our cars And we practiced right on out in the street<br>
No, we didn't have much money we barely made enough to survive<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Love and music, play..<br>

Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis we were getting pretty good at the game<br>
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name<br>
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing<br>
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.<br>

Playin for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night<br>
He smoked a big cigar, drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight<br>

Out on the streets that's where we'll meet you make the night, I always cross the line<br>
Tightened our belts, abuse ourselves get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf<br>
Another day, some other way we're gonna go, but then we'll see you again<br>
I've had enough, we've had enough cold in vain, she said<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew right from the beginning that you would end up winnin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew right from the start you'd put an arrow through my heart<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Round and round with love we'll find a way just give it time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Round and round what comes around goes around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll tell you why<br>
<br>
Lookin at you, lookin at me the way you move, you know it's easy to see<br>
The neon light's on me tonight I've got a way, we're gonna prove it tonight<br>
Like Romeo to Juliet time and time, I'm gonna make you mine<br>
I've had enough, we've had enough it's all the same, she said<br>

I don't know where I'm going, but I sure know where I've been.<br>
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday.<br>
And I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time, here I go again.<br>
<br>
Though I keep searching for an answer, I never seem to find what I'm looking for.<br>
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause I know what it means, to walk along, the lonely street of dreams.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here I go again on my own, going down the only road I've ever known.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a drifter I was born to walk alone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time.<br>

I'm just another heart in need of rescue, waiting on love's sweet charity.<br>
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days,<br>

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway<br>
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway<br>
And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble as you falter down to the ground<br>
And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying oh you were flying oh so high<br>
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer yeah they hear you calling home<br>
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us But you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad but I did it anyway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had but you couldn't share the pain<br>
<br>
No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown won't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind as you trip the final line<br>
And that cold day when you lost control shame you left my life so soon you should have told me but you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>

I said times have changed your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground they watch you suffer<br>

Well, she was an American girl raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>
And if she had to die tryin she had one little promise she was gonna keep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

Won't you come see about me? I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby<br>
Tell me your troubles and doubts giving me everything inside and out and<br>
Love's strange so real in the dark think of the tender things that we were working on<br>
Slow change may pull us apart when the light gets into your heart, baby<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you forget about me<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you stand above me, look my way, never love me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you recognize me, call my name or walk on by..<br>
<br>
Intro<br>
<br>
Don't you try to pretend it's my feeling we'll win in the end<br>
I won't harm you or touch your defenses vanity and security<br>
Don't you forget about me I'll be alone dancing you know it baby<br>
Going to take you apart I'll put us back together at heart baby<br>
<br>
 Don't you forget about me x 2<br>
 As you walk on by will you call my name? x 2<br>

You see em comin at you every night strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight<br>
You know their business, you think it's a bore, they make you restless it's nothin' you ain't seen before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get around town, spend your time on the run you never let down, say you do it for fun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never miss a play, though you make quite a few you give it all away - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
You crave attention, you can never say "no" throw your affections any way the wind blows<br>
You always make it you're on top of the scene you sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Puttin on the eyes til there's nobody else you never realize what you do to yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that they see make the daily reviews you never get free - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows you, everybody snows you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody leads you, needs you, bleeds you<br>

(Extra riff)<br>
<br>
Nights of confusion and impossible dreams days at the mirror patchin up around the seams<br>
You got your glory you paid for it all you take your pension in loneliness and alcohol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say goodbye to conventional ways you can't escape the hours you lose track of the days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you understand seems the more like you do you never get away... everybody wants you<br>

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean<br>
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen<br>
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies<br>
Knockin' me out with those American thighs<br>
<br>
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,<br>
She told me to come, but I was already there<br>
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shook me all night long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you shook me all night long<br>
<br>
Working double time on the seduction line<br>
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine<br>
Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>
<br>
Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,<br>
Now I'm back in the ring to take a-nother swing<br>
Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>
