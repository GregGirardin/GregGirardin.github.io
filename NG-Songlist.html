Jessie is a friend yeah I know, he's been a good friend of mine<br>
But lately something's changed, it ain't hard to define<br>
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's watchin' him with those eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he's holdin' her in his arms, late late at night<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Y'know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I find a woman like that?<br>
<br>
I'll play along with the charade<br>
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change<br>
Y'know I feel so dirty when they start talkin' cute<br>
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is prob'ly moot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's watchin...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time<br>

People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name<br>
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing<br>
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.<br>
<br>
Playin for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night<br>
He smoked a big cigar, drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight<br>

When I hear you on the car radio you're goin' to be a sensation!"<br>

Here we stand worlds apart, hearts broken in two<br>
Sleepless nights losing ground I'm reaching for you<br>
Feeling that it's gone can change your mind<br>
If we can't go on to survive the tide love divides<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Someday love will find you break those chains that bind you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One night will remind you how we touched and went our separate ways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If he ever hurts you true love won't desert you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I still love you though we touched and went our separate ways<br>
<br>
Troubled times caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain<br>
Distant eyes promises we made were in vain, vain, vain<br>
If you must go, I wish you love you'll never walk alone<br>
Take care my love miss you love<br>

Here comes the jesters, one, two three<br>
It's all part of my fantasy<br>
I love the music and I love to see the crowd<br>
Dancin' In the aisles and singin' out loud<br>
<br>
Here comes the dancers one by one<br>
Your mama's callin' but you're havin' fun<br>
You find you're dancin on a number nine cloud<br>
Put your hands together now and sing It out loud<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its all part of my rock and roll fantasy / dream<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
Put up the spotlights one and all<br>
And let the feelin get down to your soul<br>
The music's so loud you can hear the sound<br>
Reachin for the sky and churn in up the ground<br>
<br>
 Chorus x 2<br>

Once upon a time, not so long ago<br>
<br>
Tommy used to work on the docks union's been on strike<br>
He's down on his luck it's tough, so tough<br>
Gina works the diner all day working for her man,<br>
she brings home her pay for love, for love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She says we've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got each other and that's a lot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For love, we'll give it a shot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whooah, we're half way there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whooah, livin' on a prayer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take my hand and we'll make it I swear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whooah, livin' on a prayer<br>
<br>
Tommy's got his six string in hock bow he's holding in what he used<br>
To make it talk so tough, it's tough<br>
Gina dreams of running away when she cries in the night<br>
Tommy whispers: "Baby it's okay, someday"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got to hold on..<br>
<br>
Solo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got to hold on, ready or not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You live for the fight when that's all that you've got<br>

You know their business, you think it's a bore, they make you restless it's nothin' you ain't seen before<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Get around town, spend your time on the run you never let down, say you do it for fun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never miss a play, though you make quite a few you give it all away - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
You crave attention, you can never say "no" throw your affections any way the wind blows<br>
You always make it you're on top of the scene you sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Puttin on the eyes til there's nobody else you never realize what you do to yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that they see make the daily reviews you never get free - everybody wants you<br>

Nights of confusion and impossible dreams days at the mirror patchin up around the seams<br>
You got your glory you paid for it all you take your pension in loneliness and alcohol<br>

And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;won't you look at where we've gone<br>
