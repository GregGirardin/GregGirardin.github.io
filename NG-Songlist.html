You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go<br>

If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is gone but something might be found to take its place<br>

And you can trust me not to think and not to sleep around<br>

Well&nbsp;&nbsp;we were just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet<br>
Playin all the bars, sleepin' in our cars And we practiced right on out in the street<br>
No, we didn't have much money we barely made enough to survive<br>
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play, people came alive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock and roll band, everybody's waitin, gettin crazy, anticipating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love and music, play..<br>
<br>
Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis we were getting pretty good at the game<br>
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name<br>
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing<br>
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.<br>
<br>
Playin for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night<br>
He smoked a big cigar, drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight<br>
Sign a record company contract you know I've got great expectations<br>
When I hear you on the car radio you're goin' to be a sensation!"<br>

She's got a smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky<br>
Now and then when I see her face she takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet child of mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet love of mine<br>
<br>
She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and rain to quietly pass me by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa...<br>
<br>
Where do we go..<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew right from the beginning that you would end up winnin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew right from the start you'd put an arrow through my heart<br>

Maybe, it's not too late, to learn how to love, and forget how to hate<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds not healing life's a bitter shame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm goin off the rails on a crazy train<br>

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules<br>
One person conditioned to rule and control, the media sells it and you live the role<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds still screaming driving me insane...<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If he ever hurts you true love won't desert you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I still love you though we touched and went our separate ways<br>

Troubled times caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain<br>

Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit<br>

A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume<br>
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows searching in the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding, somewhere in the night<br>
<br>
Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill<br>
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time<br>
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues<br>

Ready to take on every deal loaded, loaded<br>

No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown won't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind as you trip the final line<br>

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find<br>

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry<br>

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>

And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>

Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>

Working double time on the seduction line<br>
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine<br>
Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>

Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,<br>

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br>
I said don't mind but what do you mean, I am the one<br>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.<br>
Then ev'ry head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,<br>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mother always told me, be careful who you love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And be careful what you do, cause the lie becomes the truth, hey<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the kid is not my son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
<br>
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side<br>
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans<br>
Cause we danced on the floor in the round.<br>
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice<br>
<br>
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me<br>
Then showed a photo. My baby cried. His eyes were like mine.<br>
Can we dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.<br>

Slipped me notes under the desk while I was thinkin' about her dress<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

<button class='accordion'>6. Play That Funky Music</button>
<div class='panel'>
Hey, do it now<br>
<br>
Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

<button class='accordion'>7. The Boys Are Back In Town</button>
<div class='panel'>
Guess who just got back today? Them wild-eyed boys that had been away<br>
Haven't changed had much to say but man, I still think them cats are crazy<br>
They were askin if you were around, how you was, where you could be found<br>
I told em you were livin' downtown drivin' all the old men crazy<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are back in town...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
You know that chick that used to dance a lot every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got<br>
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red-hot I mean, she was steamin'<br>
And that time over at Johnny's place well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face<br>
Man, we just fell about the place if that chick don't wanna know, forget her<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are back in town...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo / Break<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the word around, guess who's back in town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just spread the word around<br>
<br>
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill down at Dino's Bar'n'Grill<br>
The drink will flow and blood will spill and if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em<br>
That jukebox in the corner blastin out my favorite song the nights are getting longer, it won't be long<br>
Won't be long 'til summer comes now that the boys are here again<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are back in town..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>

He said you ain't seen nothing til you're down on a muffin, then you're sure to be changin your ways.<br>
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder, all the times I can reminisce<br>
Cause the best thing lovin with her sister and her cousin only started with a little kiss, like this!<br>
<br>
See-saw swingin with the boys in the school and your feet flyin up in the air,<br>
Singin hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle, you be swingin like you just didn't care<br>
So I took a big chance at the high school dance with a missy who was ready to play<br>
Was it me she was foolin cause she knew what she was doin and I know love was here to stay<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When she told me to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk this way.. ah, just give me a kiss (solo) like this!<br>

School girl Sadie with the classy, kinda sassy, little skirt climbing way up her knees.<br>
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker when I noticed they was lookin at me.<br>
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady till the boys told me something I missed<br>
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor so I gave her just a little kiss, like this!<br>
<br>
See-saw swingin..<br>
