Well, she was an American girl raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>
And if she had to die tryin she had one little promise she was gonna keep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

Steve walks warily down the street, with the brim pulled way down low<br>
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet, machine guns ready to go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you ready, are you ready for this are you hanging on the edge of your seat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the doorway the bullets rip, to the sound of the beat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one bites the dust, another one bites the dust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another one gone, and another one gone, another one bites the dust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I'm gonna get you too another one bites the dust<br>
<br>
How do you think I'm going to get along, without you, when you're gone<br>
You took me for everything that I had, and kicked me out on my own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you happy, are you satisfied how long can you stand the heat<br>

You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad and leave him when he's down<br>

They told him, don't you ever come around here<br>
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear<br>
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear<br>
So beat it, just beat it<br>
<br>
You better run you better do what you can<br>

You wanna be tough better do what you can<br>
So beat it, but you wanna be bad<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Just beat it beat it.. no one wants to be defeated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Showin how funky and strong is your fight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter who's wrong or right, just beat it<br>

They're out to get you, better leave while you can<br>
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man<br>
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can<br>
So beat it, just beat it<br>
<br>
You have to show them that you're really not scared<br>
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare<br>
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you then they'll tell you it's fair<br>

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br>
I said don't mind but what do you mean, I am the one<br>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.<br>
Then ev'ry head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,<br>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mother always told me, be careful who you love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And be careful what you do, cause the lie becomes the truth, hey<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the kid is not my son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
<br>
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side<br>
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans<br>
Cause we danced on the floor in the round.<br>
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice<br>
<br>
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me<br>
Then showed a photo. My baby cried. His eyes were like mine.<br>
Can we dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey<br>

Sheets of empty canvas untouched sheets of clay<br>
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did<br>
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun<br>
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and all I taught her was everything<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I know she gave me all that she wore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything<br>
<br>
I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play<br>
I can feel their laughter so why do I sear<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm spinning oh, I'm spinning how quick the sun can, drop away<br>
<br>
 And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything<br>
 All the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything<br>
 All the love gone bad turned my world to black<br>
 Tattooed all I see all that I am<br>
 All that I'll be, yeah<br>
 Uh huh, uh huh, oh<br>

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life<br>
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky<br>

And I've always been a patient man but my patience has reached its end<br>

Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world<br>
She took the midnight train going anywhere<br>
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit<br>
He took the midnight train going anywhere<br>
<br>
A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume<br>
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows searching in the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding, somewhere in the night<br>
<br>
Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill<br>
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time<br>
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues<br>
Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers waiting...<br>
<br>
Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling. Streetlight people<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Get around town, spend your time on the run you never let down, say you do it for fun<br>

You crave attention, you can never say "no" throw your affections any way the wind blows<br>
You always make it you're on top of the scene you sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Puttin on the eyes til there's nobody else you never realize what you do to yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that they see make the daily reviews you never get free - everybody wants you<br>

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway<br>
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway<br>

And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oh you were flying oh so high<br>

But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer<br>
Yeah they hear you calling home<br>
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us<br>
But you left me far behind<br>

No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;won't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt I'm after you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found and I'm hungry like the wolf<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme, I howl and I whine, I'm after you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouth is a-live, all running in-side, and I'm hungry like the wolf<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme, I'm on the hunt, I'm after you<br>

people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time<br>
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy<br>
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you help me occupy my brain?<br>
<br>
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find<br>
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind<br>
<br>
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry<br>
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal<br>
<br>
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state<br>
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late<br>

<div class='panel'>
Hey, do it now<br>
<br>
Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back<br>
and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>

Well&nbsp;&nbsp;we were just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet<br>
Playin all the bars, sleepin' in our cars And we practiced right on out in the street<br>
No, we didn't have much money we barely made enough to survive<br>
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play, people came alive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock and roll band, everybody's waitin, gettin crazy, anticipating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love and music, play..<br>
<br>
Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis we were getting pretty good at the game<br>
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name<br>
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing<br>
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.<br>
<br>
Playin for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night<br>
He smoked a big cigar, drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight<br>
Sign a record company contract you know I've got great expectations<br>
When I hear you on the car radio you're goin' to be a sensation!"<br>

<div class='panel'>
Yeah I get it, you're an outcast always under attack<br>
always coming in last bringing up the past<br>
No one owes you anything I think you need a shotgun blast<br>
A kick in the ass so paranoid watch your back<br>
<br>
Oh my, here we go another loose cannon gone bipolar<br>
Slipped down, couldn't get much lower<br>
Quicksand's got no sense of humor I'm still laughing like hell<br>
<br>
You think that by cryin to me lookin' so sorry, that I'm gonna believe<br>
You've been infected by a social disease well then, take your medicine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I created the sound of madness, wrote the book on pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow I'm still here, to explain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the darkest hour never comes in the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can sleep with a gun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you gonna wake up and fight... for yourself<br>
<br>
I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality<br>
If there's an afterlife, then it'll set you free<br>
But I'm not gonna part the seas you're a self-fulfilling prophecy<br>
You think that by cryin' to me lookin' so sorry, that I'm gonna believe<br>
You've been infected by a social disease well then, take your medicine<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah. Me and my baby in '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of '69, yeah.<br>

She's got a smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky<br>
Now and then when I see her face she takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet child of mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet love of mine<br>

She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and rain to quietly pass me by<br>

You stand in the front just a shakin your ass<br>

See-saw swingin with the boys in the school and your feet flyin up in the air,<br>
Singin hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle, you be swingin like you just didn't care<br>
So I took a big chance at the high school dance with a missy who was ready to play<br>
Was it me she was foolin cause she knew what she was doin and I know love was here to stay<br>

There was three young ladies in the school gym locker when I noticed they was lookin at me.<br>

Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,<br>

Working double time on the seduction line<br>

Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>
