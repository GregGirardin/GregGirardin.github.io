You've got to trust your instinct, and let go of regret<br>
You've got to bet on yourself now star cause that's your best bet<br>
Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said<br>
<br>
We come with the funky style that gets us known for the show<br>
And we'll mix the hip-hop reggae if we say it is so<br>
And fuck the naysayers cause they don't mean a thing<br>
Cause this is what style we bring<br>
<br>
Now it's morning but last night's on my mind<br>
There's something I need to get off my chest<br>
And no matter what may come to shine<br>
The dream will always be mine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All mixed up, you don't know what to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Next thing you turn around and find the person is you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought a freak might be the thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the first could be the last, so just get off of your ass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All mixed up, you don't know what to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Next thing you turn around and find the person is you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought a freak might be the thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But you know this will pass, so just get off of your ass<br>
<br>
You've got to trust your instinct, and let go of regret<br>
You've got to bet on yourself now star cause that's your best bet<br>
Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said<br>
Sick sick bit got to have it<br>
Like bustin' in on a session but you got to call it quits<br>
Sick sick bit just can't quit<br>
Fact that you don't even know makes it fully legit<br>
<br>
Now it's morning but last night's on my mind...<br>
<br>
You keep me coming, that is a gal that'll kill dem stunning x 4<br>
<br>
You make me nervous, throat dry, my brain is empty, don't know why<br>
But I saw you doing something which is really truly nothing<br>
But you could bust me out all day<br>
<br>
Many moons since first I saw you, many moons since first we did the do<br>
Many moons since first I saw you, ,any moons since first we did the do<br>
And why did I try when I knew it was no and<br>
Why did I try when I say it was so<br>
But save it for late we should just let it skate<br>
Cause the waiting feel is fine<br>

Were laid spread out before me as her body once did<br>
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun<br>
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and all I taught her was everything<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I know she gave me all that she wore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything<br>

I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play<br>
I can feel their laughter so why do I sear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm spinning oh, I'm spinning how quick the sun can, drop away<br>

Like the latest fashion<br>
Like a spreading disease<br>
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom<br>
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease<br>
The gangs stake out their own campus locale<br>
And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal<br>
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix<br>
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, come out and play<br>

By the time you hear the siren<br>
It's already too late<br>
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail<br>
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste<br>
It goes down the same as the thousand before<br>

Must've been mid afternoon<br>
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and<br>
He walked with a purpose<br>
In his sneakers, down the street<br>
He had many questions like children often do, he said:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me am I very far<br>
<br>
Must've been late afternoon<br>
on our way the sun broke free of the clouds<br>
We count only blue cars<br>
Skip the cracks in the street<br>
And ask many questions like children often do, we said:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God cause I'd really like to meet her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask her why we're who we are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God cause I'm on my way to see her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me am I very far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I very far now?<br>
<br>
It's getting cold, picked up the pace.<br>
How our shoes make hard noises in this place.<br>
Our clothes are stained<br>
We pass many cross-eyed people<br>
And ask many questions like children often do<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice.<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are?<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>
<br>
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>
And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them<br>
Ever since I was little it looked like fun<br>
And it's no coincidence I've come and I can die when I'm done<br>

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway<br>
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway<br>
And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble as you falter down to the ground<br>
And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying oh you were flying oh so high<br>
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer yeah they hear you calling home<br>
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us But you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad but I did it anyway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had but you couldn't share the pain<br>
<br>
No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown won't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind as you trip the final line<br>
And that cold day when you lost control shame you left my life so soon you should have told me but you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
I said times have changed your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground they watch you suffer<br>
Yeah, they hold you down gold you down now maybe oh oh, maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but you left me far behind<br>

I had visions, I was in them, I was looking into the mirror<br>
to see a little bit clearer, the rottenness and evil in me<br>
Fingertips have memories, mine can't forget the curves of your body<br>
And when I feel a bit naughty, I run it up the flagpole and see who salutes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but no one ever does<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot, cause I'm in hell<br>
<br>
Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding<br>
The cretins cloning and feeding, and I don't even own a TV<br>
Put me in the hospital for nerves and then they had to commit me<br>
You told them all I was crazy, they cut off my legs now I'm an amputee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;god damn you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot, cause I'm in hell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sick but I'm not well, and it's a sin, to live so well<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna publish 'zines, and rage against machines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna pierce my tongue, it doesn't hurt, it feels fine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trivial sublime, I'd like to turn off time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and kill my mind, you kill my mind<br>
<br>
Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's comin' to get me<br>
Just say you never met me, I'm going underground with the moles (to get holes)<br>
Hear the voices in my head, I swear to god it sounds like they're snoring<br>
But if you're bored then you're boring, the agony and the irony they're killing me.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake up this madness, as I held you tight So long ago<br>
<br>
I won't be coming home tonight my generation will put it right<br>
We're not just making promises that we know we'll never keep<br>
<br>
 P1<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is the world we live in and these are the hands we're given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Use them and let's start trying to make it a place worth fighting for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world we live in and these are the names we're given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand up and let's start showing just where our lives are going to<br>

Tied to a wheel, my fingers got to feel<br>
Bleeding through a tourniquet smile<br>

For our love, for our fear<br>
For our rise against the years and years and years<br>

Johnny take a walk with your sister the moon<br>
Let her pale light in to fill up your room<br>
You've been living underground eating from a can<br>
You've been running away from what you don't understand, love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She's slippy you're sliding down she'll be there when you hit the ground<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's alright.. she moves in mysterious ways<br>
<br>
Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain<br>
Let her talk about the things you can't explain<br>
To touch is to heal to hurt is to steal<br>
If you want to kiss the sky better learn how to kneel, on your knees boy!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She's the wave she turns the tide she sees the man inside the child...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift my days, light up my nights, oh<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day you'll look back and you'll see where you were held low<br>

Twenty thousand miles to an oasis. Twenty thousand years will I burn<br>
Twenty thousand chances I wasted. Waiting for the moment to turn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I would give my life to find it I would give it all. Catch me if I fall<br>

Walking through the woods I have faced. It looking for something to learn<br>
Thirty thousand thoughts have replaced it. Never in my time to return<br>

Forty thousand stars in the evening. Look at them fall from the sky<br>
Forty thousand reasons for living. Forty thousand tears in your eye<br>

Has our conscience shown? Has the sweet breeze blown?<br>
Has all kindness gone? Hope still lingers on.<br>

Are we listening? Hymns of offering.<br>
Have we eyes to see? Love is gathering.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Have now started the act of bleeding into one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I walk up on high and I step to the edge to see my world below.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I laugh at myself while the tears roll down<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything, everything will be just fine,<br>

Haven't seen you in quite a while I was down the hold, just passing time<br>
Last time we met was a low lit room we were as close together as bride and groom<br>
We ate the food, we drank the wine everybody having a good time<br>
Except you, you were talking about the end of the world<br>
<br>
I took the money, I spiked your drink you miss too much these days if you stop to think<br>
You led me on with those innocent eyes you know I love the element of surprise<br>
In the garden I was playing the tart I kissed your lips and broke your heart<br>
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world<br>
<br>
Solo<br>
<br>
In my dream I was drowning my sorrows but my sorrows they learned to swim<br>
Surrounding me, going down on me spilling over the brim<br>
Waves of regret, waves of joy I reached out for the one I tried to destroy<br>
You, you said you'd wait 'til the end of the world.<br>

Your eyes are wide and though your soul, it can't be bought<br>
Your mind can wander<br>

The night is full of holes cause bullets rip the sky of ink with gold<br>
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll<br>
They know that they can't dance, at least they know<br>
I can't stand the beat, I'm asking for the check<br>
Girl with crimson nails has Jesus around her neck<br>
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music (whoa, whoa)<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street. Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet.<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high. I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.<br>
<br>
Life is too short so love the one you got. Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same. Livin with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>
