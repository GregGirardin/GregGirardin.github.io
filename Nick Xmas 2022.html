Key: Cm<br>
<br>
I don't care if Monday's blue, Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too<br>
Thursday I don't care about you it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
Monday you can fall apart, Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart<br>
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start, it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday wait, and Sunday always comes too late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Friday never hesitate<br>
<br>
I don't care if Monday's black, Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack<br>
Thursday never looking back it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Monday you can hold your head Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed<br>
Or Thursday watch the walls instead It's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday wait..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed up to the eyes it's a wonderful surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see your shoes and your spirits rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as sleek as a shriek spinning 'round and 'round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always take a big bite it's such a gorgeous sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see you eat in the middle of the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can never get enough, enough of this stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
Verse 1<br>

<button class='accordion'>2. Some Kind Of Wonderful</button>
<div class='panel'>
I don't need a whole lots of money, I don't need a big fine car<br>
I got everything that a man could want, I got more than I could ask for<br>
And I don't have to run around I don't have to stay out all night<br>
'Cause I got me a sweet, a sweet loving woman and she know just how to treat me right<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my baby, she's alright, my baby's clean out of sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you know that she is? she's some kind of wonderful..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she is.<br>
<br>
When I hold her in my arms you know she sets my soul on fire<br>
Oh, when my baby kisses me my heart becomes filled with desire<br>
When she wraps her loving arms around me it bout drives me out of my mind<br>
Yeah, when my baby kisses me chills run up and down my spine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is there anybody got a sweet little woman like mine?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's got to be somebody got a sweet little woman like mine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, now can I get a witness?<br>

<br>
Well, she was an American girl raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>
And if she had to die tryin she had one little promise she was gonna keep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>
<br>

<br>
Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?<br>
My homeroom homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat<br>
She was pure like snowflakes, no one could ever stain<br>
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Years go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My angel is the centerfold, angel is the centerfold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold<br>
<br>
Slipped me notes under the desk while I was thinkin' about her dress<br>
I was shy, I turned away before she caught my eye<br>
I was shakin' in my shoes whenever she flashed those baby-blues<br>
Something had a hold on me when angel passed close by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those soft and fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see her in that negligee is really just too much<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Na na<br>
<br>
It's okay I understand, this ain't no never-never land<br>
I hope that when this issue's gone I'll see you when your clothes are on<br>
Take your car, yes we will, we'll take your car and drive it<br>
We'll take it to a motel room and take 'em off in private<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A part of me has just been ripped, the pages from my mind are stripped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no, I can't deny it, oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Na na<br>

<button class='accordion'>6. One Thing Leads To Another</button>
<div class='panel'>
The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Break *<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another..<br>
<br>
Then it's easy to believe, somebody's been lying to me<br>
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>

You start a conversation you can't even finish it<br>
You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything<br>
When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed<br>
Say something once, why say it again?<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ce que j'ai fais ce soir la<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ce qu' elle a dit ce soir la<br>

We are vain and we are blind<br>
I hate people when they're not polite<br>

I close my eyes on this sunny day<br>
Say something once, why say it again?<br>

<button class='accordion'>8. Cheap Sunglasses</button>
<div class='panel'>
When you wake up in the morning and the light has hurt your head<br>
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed<br>
Is hit the streets a-runnin' and try to beat the masses<br>
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
Spied a little thing and I followed her all night<br>
In a funky fine Levi's and her sweater's kind of tight<br>
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molasses<br>
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah!<br>
<br>

<button class='accordion css_medleyEnd'>15. Johnny B. Goode</button>
<div class='panel'>
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans<br>
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood<br>
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
Who never ever learned to read or write so well<br>
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, go.. go Johnny, go, go Johnny B. Goode<br>
<br>
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track<br>
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade<br>
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made<br>
The people passing by they would stop and say<br>
"Oh my what that little country boy could play"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
His mother told him "someday you will be a man<br>
And you will be the leader of a big old band<br>
Many people coming from miles around<br>
To hear you play your music when the sun go down<br>
Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
</div>

<button class='accordion'>15. My Sharona</button>
<div class='panel'>
Ooh, my little pretty one, my pretty one<br>
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?<br>
Ooh, you make my motor run, my motor run<br>
Got it comin' off of the line, Sharona<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My, my, my, ay, ah, woh!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M-m-m-my Sharona<br>
<br>
Come a little closer, hon, a-will you, hon?<br>
Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona<br>
Keep it in a mystery, you're kissing me<br>
Running down the length of my thighs, Sharona<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M-m-m-my Sharona x 2<br>
<br>
When you gonna give to me, g-give to me?<br>
Is it just a matter of time, Sharona?<br>
Is it d-d-destiny, d-destiny?<br>
Or is it just a game in my mind, Sharona?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M-m-m-m-m-m-m-my, my, my, ay, ah, woh!<br>
<br>
M-m-m-my Sharona x 4<br>
<br>
Oh, my Sharona<br>
