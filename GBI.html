&nbsp;&nbsp;No, woman, no cry...<br>

Cause, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown<br>
Observing the hypocrites mingle with the good people we meet<br>
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost along the way<br>
In this great future, you can't forget your past so dry your tears, I say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No, woman, no cry. Little darlin', don't shed no tears<br>
<br>
Said, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown.<br>
And then Georgie would make the fire light log wood burnin through the night<br>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge of which I'll share with you<br>
My feet is my only carriage so I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything's gonna be all right<br>

Try to see it my way. Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on<br>
While you see it your way, run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone<br>
We can work it out<br>
<br>
Think of what you're saying. You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright<br>
Think of what I'm saying. We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight<br>
We can work it out<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always thought that it's a crime so I will ask you once again<br>
<br>
Try to see it my way only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong<br>
While you see it your way there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long<br>
We can work it out<br>

Now here you go again you say you want your freedom well who am I to keep you down?<br>
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it<br>
But listen carefully to the sound<br>
Of your loneliness, like a heartbeat drives you mad<br>
In the stillness of remembering what you had<br>
And what you lost, and what you had, and what you lost<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Players only love you when they're playing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Women they will come and they will go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rain washes you clean you'll know, you'll know<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Now here I go again I see your crystal visions, I keep my visions to myself<br>
It's only me who wants to wrap around you dreams and<br>
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell<br>
Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad<br>
In the stillness of remembering what you had<br>
And what you lost, and what you had, ooh what you lost<br>

I came back to let you know got a thing for you and I can't let it go<br>

My friends wonder what is wrong with me, well I'm in a daze from your love you see<br>
I came back to let you know got a thing for you and I can't let it go<br>

And they may never find what they dream of<br>

Searching in the sun for another overload<br>
I hear you singing in the wires, I can hear you through the whine<br>
And the Wichita lineman.. is still on the line<br>

I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain<br>
And, if it snows, that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain<br>
And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time<br>
And the Wichita lineman...<br>

On the first part of the journey I was lookin at all the life<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz and the sky with no clouds<br>
The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it felt good to be out of the rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the desert you can remember your name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la<br>
<br>
After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground and the perfect disguise above<br>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

If the night turned cold and the stars looked down<br>
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground<br>
you wake the morning in a stranger's coat no one would you see<br>
You ask yourself, who'd watch for me my only friend, who could it be<br>
It's hard to say it I hate to say it, but it's probably me<br>
<br>
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real<br>
and you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal<br>
you search the city for your only friend no one would you see<br>
Ask yourself, who'd watch for me a solitary voice to speak out and set me free...<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You're not the easiest person I ever got to know<br>

I'm feelin the strain, ain't it a shame<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away<br>
<br>
Beginning to think that I'm wastin time<br>
I don't understand the things I do<br>
The world outside looks so unkind<br>
I'm counting on you to carry me through<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when my mind is free you know a melody can move me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I'm feelin blue the guitar's comin through to soothe me<br>
<br>
Thanks for the joy that you've given me<br>
I want you to know I believe in your song<br>
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony<br>
You help me along makin me strong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.<br>
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town<br>
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.<br>

But you're here alone, there's no one to compete.<br>
If Mercy's a bus'ness, I wish it for you<br>
More than just ashes when your dreams come true.<br>

If there's one thing in my life that's missing it's the time that I spend alone<br>
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water<br>
There's lots of those friendly people they're showing me ways to go<br>
But I never want to lose their inspiration<br>

Got out of town on a boat goin to southern islands sailing a reach before a followin sea<br>
She was makin for the trades on the outside and the downhill run to Papeete Bay<br>
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas we got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way<br>
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you but on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about how many times I have fallen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits are using me, larger voices callin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been around the world lookin' for that woman, girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows love can endure and you know it will and you know it will<br>
<br>
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time you understand now why you came this way<br>
'Cause the truth you might be runnin from is so small but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day<br>
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dyin and my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain<br>
I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin she is all that I have left and music is her name<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
So we cheated and we lied and we tested and we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do<br>
You will survive being bested but somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you<br>

Friday night I'm going nowhere all the lights are changing green to red<br>
Turning over TV stations situations running through my head<br>
Looking back through time you know it's clear that I've been blind, I've been a fool<br>
To open up my heart to all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule<br>
<br>
Saturday I'm running wild and all the lights are changing red to green<br>
Moving through the crowds I'm pushing chemicals are rushing in my bloodstream<br>
Only wish that you were here, you know I'm seeing it so clear I've been afraid<br>
To show you how I really feel admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you want it, come and get it, crying out loud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The love that I was giving you was, never in doubt<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street. Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet.<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high. I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.<br>
<br>
Life is too short so love the one you got. Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same. Livin with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>

<button class='accordion'>4. The Gambler</button>
<div class='panel'>
D (G D) [G A / A D]<br>
<br>
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked my to stay and told me to sit anywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair<br>

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird has flown<br>
So I lit a fire, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>

High and dry in the long hot day. Lost and lonely in every way.<br>

I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream<br>
I cannot make a single sound as you scream<br>
It can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch<br>
We touch, this place is so quiet, sensing that storm<br>
<br>
Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town<br>
They tell you that this rain can sting, and look down<br>
There is no blood around see no sign of pain<br>
No pain, seeing no red at all, see no rain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just let the red rain splash you, let the rain fall on your skin<br>

Do you think you can tell?<br>
<br>
Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change<br>
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage<br>
<br>
How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year<br>
Running over the same old ground what have we found<br>
the same old fears. Wish you were here<br>

I don't know, don't really care let there be songs to fill the air.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripple in still water when there is no pebble tossed nor wind to blow<br>
<br>
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty if your cup is full may it be again.<br>
Let it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of men.<br>
There is a road, no simple highway between the dawn and the dark of night.<br>
And if you go no one may follow that path is for your steps alone.<br>

And though the news was rather sad well, I just had to laugh<br>
I saw the photograph<br>
<br>
He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed<br>
A crowd of people stood and stared they'd seen his face before<br>
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords<br>
<br>
I saw a film today oh boy, the English Army had just won the war<br>
A crowd of people turned away but I just had to look<br>
Having read the book.. I'd love to turn you on<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up,<br>

There was something so pleasant about that place<br>

But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>

And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>

Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>

Now I see a family where there once was none, now we've just begun,<br>
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.<br>
<br>
Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup<br>
Drink it up, love her and she'll bring you luck.<br>
And if you find she helps your mind, buddy, take her home,<br>
Don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own.<br>

Got to stop believin' in all your lies<br>
Cause I got to much to do before I die<br>

Don't get too lost in all I say<br>
If half the time I really felt that way<br>
That was then and now it's today<br>
Can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay<br>
Before someone comes along and takes my place<br>
With a different name and yes a different face<br>

Diamond life, lover boy we move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.<br>
City lights and business nights when you require streetcar desire for higher heights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No place for beginners or sensitive hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When sentiment is left to chance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No place to be ending but somewhere to start.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to ask, he's a smooth operator...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Face to face, each classic case.<br>
We shadow box and double cross, yet need the chase.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A license to love, insurance to hold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Melts all your memories and change into gold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

It's another tequila sunrise staring slowly cross the sky said goodbye<br>
He was just a hired hand workin on a dream he planned to try the days go by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Every night when the sun goes down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just another lonely boy in town and she's out runnin round<br>
<br>
She wasn't just another woman and I couldn't keep from comin on it's been so long<br>
Oh and it's a hollow feelin when it comes down to dealin friends it never ends.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another shot of courage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonder why the right words never come, you just get numb<br>
<br>
It's another tequila sunrise this old world still looks the same another frame.<br>

Sometimes late when things are real and people share the<br>
gift of gab between themselves<br>
Some are quick to take the bait and catch the perfect<br>
prize that waits among the shells<br>
<br>
But Oz never did give nothing to the tin man<br>
That he didn't already have<br>
And cause never was the reason for the evening<br>
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad<br>
So please believe in me<br>
<br>
When I say I'm spinning round, round<br>
Smoke glass stain'd bright colors<br>
Image going down down soapsud green like bubbles<br>
Oooh...<br>

Chewing on a piece of grass, walking down the road<br>
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here, Joe?<br>
Some people say, this town don't look good in snow<br>
You don't care, I know<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ventura Highway, in the sunshine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the days are longer the nights are stronger than moonshine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You're gonna go, I know<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause the free wind is blowing through your hair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the days surround your daylight there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seasons crying, no despair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alligator lizards in the air, in the air.. Doo..<br>
<br>
Wishing on a falling star, waiting for the early train<br>
Sorry, boy, but I've been hit by purple rain<br>
Aww, come on, Joe, you can always change your name<br>
Thanks a lot, son, just the same<br>

See the stone set in your eyes<br>
See the thorn twist in your side, I wait for you<br>
<br>
Sleight of hand and twist of fate<br>
On a bed of nails she makes me wait, and I wait without you<br>
With or without you<br>
<br>
Through the storm we reach the shore<br>
You give it all but I want more, and I'm waiting for you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With or without you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't live with or without you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you give yourself away...<br>

My hands are tied, my body bruised, she's got me with<br>
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose<br>

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you<br>
By now you should've somehow realised what you gotta do<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
<br>
Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out<br>
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the roads we have to walk are winding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the lights that lead us there are blinding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things that I would Like to say to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't know how<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after all you're my wonderwall<br>
