She floats like a swan, grace on the water<br>
Lips like sugar, lips like sugar<br>
Just when you think you've caught her, she glides across the water<br>
She calls for you tonight, to share this moonlight<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll flow down her river she'll ask you and you'll give her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lips like sugar sugar kisses x 2<br>
<br>
She knows what she knows I know what she's thinking<br>
Sugar kisses sugar kisses<br>
Just when you think she's yours she's flown to other shores<br>
To laugh at how you break and melt into this lake<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll flow down...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lips like sugar sugar kisses x 2<br>

Solo<br>

She'll be my mirror reflect what I am<br>
A loser and a winner the king of Siam<br>
And my siamese twin alone on the river<br>
Mirror kisses, mirror kisses<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lips like sugar sugar kisses x 4<br>

Someone falls to pieces sleepin all alone someone kills the pain<br>
Spinning in the silence to finally drift away<br>
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard catches a bouquet<br>
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be yourself is all that you can do x 2<br>
<br>
Someone finds salvation in everyone and another only pain<br>
Someone tries to hide himself down inside himself he prays<br>
Someone swears his true love until the end of time another runs away<br>
Separate or united? [G] Healthy or insane? [Em]<br>

<br>
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street. Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet.<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high. I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.<br>
<br>
Life is too short so love the one you got. Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same. Livin with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.<br>

I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair and I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs<br>
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you.<br>
<br>
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you and I'm wondering what it is I should do<br>
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place..<br>
Clowns to the left..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well you started out with nothing and you're proud that you're a self made man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And your friends they all come crawlin slap you on the back and say please, please<br>
<br>
Trying to make some sense of it all but I can see that it makes no sense at all<br>
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor cause I don't think that I can take anymore.<br>

The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>

Take a minute to concentrate and she opens up her eyes<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was moving she was right there with it and she was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was moving she was floating above it and she was<br>
<br>
And she was drifting through the backyard, and she was taking off her dress<br>
And she was moving very slowly, rising up above the earth<br>
Moving into the universe and she's drifting this way and that<br>
Not touching the ground at all and she's up above the yard<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was glad about it, no doubt about it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She isn't sure bout what she's done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time to think about what to tell them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time to think about what she's done and she was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey...<br>
<br>
And she was looking at herself, and things were looking like a movie<br>
She had a pleasant elevation, she's moving out in all directions<br>
Hey hey hey...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was moving she was right there with it and she was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was moving she was floating above it and she was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joining the world of missing persons and she was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing enough to feel alright and she was and she was<br>

Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>

I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;HIGB when you're sure I'm not there?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;HIGB when there's no one there to talk to?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between you and me, cause I don't care, how's it gonna be?<br>
<br>
Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match. Sharp as a thumbnail<br>
scratch. Silence I can't ignore hammock by the doorway<br>
we spent time in, swing's empty I don't see lightning like last fall,<br>
when it was always about to hit me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;HIGB when it goes down?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;HIGB when you're not around?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;HIGB when you found out there was nothing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;between you and me, cause I don't care, how's it gonna be.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIGB when you don't know me anymore, HIGB<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanna get myself back in again. The soft dive of oblivion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna taste the salt of your skin. The soft dive of oblivion..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HHIGB when you don't know me anymore, HIGB<br>
