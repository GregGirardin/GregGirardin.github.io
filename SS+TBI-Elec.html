She floats like a swan, grace on the water<br>
Lips like sugar, lips like sugar<br>
Just when you think you've caught her, she glides across the water<br>
She calls for you tonight, to share this moonlight<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou'll flow down her river she'll ask you and you'll give her<br>
&nbsp&nbspLips like sugar sugar kisses x 2<br>
<br>
She knows what she knows I know what she's thinking<br>
Sugar kisses sugar kisses<br>
Just when you think she's yours she's flown to other shores<br>
To laugh at how you break and melt into this lake<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou'll flow down...<br>
&nbsp&nbspLips like sugar sugar kisses x 2<br>
<br>
Solo<br>
<br>
She'll be my mirror reflect what I am<br>
A loser and a winner the king of Siam<br>
And my siamese twin alone on the river<br>
Mirror kisses, mirror kisses<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspLips like sugar sugar kisses x 4<br>

Someone falls to pieces sleepin all alone someone kills the pain<br>
Spinning in the silence to finally drift away<br>
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard catches a bouquet<br>
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspTo be yourself is all that you can do x 2<br>
<br>
Someone finds salvation in everyone and another only pain<br>
Someone tries to hide himself down inside himself he prays<br>
Someone swears his true love until the end of time another runs away<br>
Separate or united? [G] Healthy or insane? [Em]<br>

&nbsp&nbspTo be yourself is all that you can do x 4<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd even when you've paid enough, been pulled apart, or been held up<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspPlenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspThey living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStandin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMan we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStanding on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah. Me and my baby in '69, oh.<br>

There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp&nbspeven your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street. Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet.<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high. I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.<br>
<br>
Life is too short so love the one you got. Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspLovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same. Livin with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>

How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year<br>
Running over the same old ground what have we found<br>
the same old fears. Wish you were here<br>

In the cool of the evening, when everything is getting kind of groovy,<br>
I call you up, and ask you if you'd like to go with me and see a movie,<br>
First you say no, you've got some plans for the night,<br>
Then you stop, and say... alright,<br>
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you!<br>
<br>
You always keep me guessing, I never seem to know what you are thinking,<br>
And if a feller looks at you, it's for sure your little eye will be awinking,<br>
I get confused, cause I don't know where I stand,<br>
And then you smile, and hold my hand,<br>
Love is kinda crazy..<br>

If you decide, someday, to stop this little game that you are playing,<br>
I'm gonna tell you the only thing my heart is dying to be saying,<br>
Just like a ghost, you've been haunting my dreams,<br>
So I'll propose...&nbsp&nbspon Halloween,<br>
Love is kinda crazy...<br>

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone. it's not warm when she's away.<br>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and she's always gone too long,<br>
Anytime she goes away.<br>
<br>
Wonder this time where she's gone, wonder if she's gone to stay<br>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home,<br>
Anytime she goes away.<br>
<br>
And I know, I know...<br>
Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone<br>
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone<br>
<br>

But ain't no sunshine when she's gone, only darkness everyday.<br>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home<br>
Anytime she goes away.<br>
