I was cuttin' the rug down at a place called 'The Jug' with a girl named Linda Lou<br>
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand, he was looking for you know who.<br>
He said "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow, watcha tryin to prove?<br>
Cuz thats my woman there and I'm a man who cares and this might be all for you"<br>
(I said "excuse me!")<br>
<br>
I was scared and fearing for my life,I was shaking like a leaf on a tree<br>
Cuz he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord, a pointing that gun at me<br>
"Oh wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her, don't want no trouble with you<br>
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me ask one favor from you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, won't you gimme three steps .. mister .. toward the door?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gimme three steps .. mister and you'll never see me no more. For sure<br>
<br>
Oh, well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray and the water fell on the floor.<br>
And I'm telling you, son, well it ain't no fun, staring straight down a forty-four.<br>
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou, and that's the break I was looking for<br>
and you could hear me screaming a mile away as I was headed out toward the door.<br>
<br>

Hey, mamma look at me I'm on the way to the promised land<br>

I met her, just a barroom queen in Memphis<br>
She tried to make me upstairs for a ride<br>
She had to carry me right across her shoulder<br>
Cause I just can't seem to drink her off of my mind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She's a honky tonk woman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gimme... the honky tonk girl.<br>
<br>
I met her either say in New York City<br>
I had to put up a one heck of a fight<br>
The lady said she'd covered me with roses<br>
She broke my nose and then she broke my mind.<br>

She grew up in an Indiana town had a good-lookin mama who never was around<br>
But she grew up tall and she grew up right with them Indiana boys on an Indiana night<br>
<br>
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen she blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen<br>
I was introduced and we both started groovin' she said, "I dig you baby but I got to keep movin'"<br>

Well, I don't know, but I've been told you never slow down, you never grow old<br>
I'm tired of screwing up, I'm tired of going down tired of myself, tired of this town<br>

She's got a smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky<br>
Now and then when I see her face she takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet child of mine / love of mine<br>
<br>
She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and rain to quietly pass me by<br>

He said you ain't seen nothing til you're down on a muffin, then you're sure to be changin your ways.<br>
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder, all the times I can reminisce<br>
Cause the best thing lovin with her sister and her cousin only started with a little kiss, like this!<br>
<br>
See-saw swingin with the boys in the school and your feet flyin up in the air,<br>
Singin hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle, you be swingin like you just didn't care<br>
So I took a big chance at the high school dance with a missy who was ready to play<br>
Was it me she was foolin cause she knew what she was doin and I know love was here to stay<br>

She was the best damn woman that I ever seen<br>
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies<br>
Knockin' me out with those American thighs<br>
<br>
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,<br>
She told me to come, but I was already there<br>
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shook me all night long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you shook me all night long<br>
<br>
Working double time on the seduction line<br>
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine<br>
Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>
<br>
Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,<br>
Now I'm back in the ring to take a-nother swing<br>
Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
