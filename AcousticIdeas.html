I read the news today, oh boy about a lucky man who made the grade<br>
And though the news was rather sad well, I just had to laugh<br>
I saw the photograph<br>
<br>
He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed<br>
A crowd of people stood and stared they'd seen his face before<br>
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords<br>
<br>
I saw a film today oh boy, the English Army had just won the war<br>
A crowd of people turned away but I just had to look<br>
Having read the book.. I'd love to turn you on<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed I was late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way upstairs and had a smoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and somebody spoke and I went into a dream<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhh..<br>
<br>
I read the news today oh boy, four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire<br>
And though the holes were rather small they had to count them all<br>
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall<br>
I'd love to turn you on<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that I could stay with you, for a while maybe longer if I do<br>

Don't you think the time is right for us to find.<br>
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time and can you see<br>
Which way we should turn together or alone?<br>
I can never see what's right or what is wrong<br>

I feel so unsure as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor<br>
As the music dies, something in your eyes<br>
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it's easy to pretend I know your not a fool<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should've known better than to cheat a friend and waste the chance that I've been given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you<br>
<br>
Time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend<br>
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind<br>
There's no comfort in the truth pain is all you'll find<br>
<br>
Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd<br>
Maybe it's better this way we'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say<br>
We could have been so good together we could have lived this dance forever<br>
But no one's gonna dance with me, please stay<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice.<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are?<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>
<br>
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>
And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them<br>
Ever since I was little it looked like fun<br>
And it's no coincidence I've come and I can die when I'm done<br>

I lit out from Reno I was trailed by twenty hounds<br>
Didn't get to sleep last night till the morning came around<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Set out runnin but I take my time a friend of the devil is a friend of mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I get home before daylight I just might get some sleep tonight<br>
<br>
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills<br>
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills<br>
<br>
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there<br>
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie and she's my hearts delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one is prison, babe the sheriff's on my trail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he catches up with me I'll spend my life in jail<br>
<br>
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee<br>
The first one says she's got my child but it don't look like me<br>

Just like children sleeping we could dream this night away<br>
But there's a full moon rising let's go dancing in the light<br>
We know where the music's playing let's go out and feel the night.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I'm still in love with you, I want to see you dance again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I'm still in love with you, on this harvest moon.<br>
<br>
When we were strangers I watched you from afar<br>
When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart.<br>
But now its gettin late and the moon is climbing high<br>
I want to celebrate see it shining in your eye.<br>

On the first part of the journey I was lookin at all the life<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz and the sky with no clouds<br>
The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it felt good to be out of the rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the desert you can remember your name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la<br>
<br>
After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground and the perfect disguise above<br>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

At first I was afraid, I was petrified<br>
I kept thinkin I could never live without you by my side<br>
But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you've done me wrong<br>
I grew strong, I learned how to get along<br>
<br>
And so you're back from outer space<br>
I just walked in to find you here with that look upon your face,<br>
Should have changed my stupid lock, I should've made you leave your key<br>
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh now go, walk out the door<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh not I, I will survive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will survive, I will survive, yeah<br>
<br>
It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart<br>
I'm tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart<br>
And I spent oh so many nights just feelin sorry for myself<br>
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high<br>
<br>
And you'll see me with somebody new<br>
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you<br>
And so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to be free<br>
But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me<br>

If the night turned cold and the stars looked down<br>
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground<br>
you wake the morning in a stranger's coat no one would you see<br>
You ask yourself, who'd watch for me my only friend, who could it be<br>
It's hard to say it I hate to say it, but it's probably me<br>
<br>
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real<br>
and you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal<br>
you search the city for your only friend no one would you see<br>
Ask yourself, who'd watch for me a solitary voice to speak out and set me free...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You're not the easiest person I ever got to know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would say I should let you go your way you'll only make me cry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there's one guy, just one guy who'd lay down his life for you and die...<br>
<br>
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense<br>
There's only one voice that comes to your defense<br>
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room and one friendly face is all you need to see<br>
If there's one guy, just one guy who'd lay down his life for you and die...<br>

We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>

The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>

But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Red rain is pouring down, pouring down, all over me<br>
<br>
I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream<br>
I cannot make a single sound as you scream<br>
It can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch<br>
We touch, this place is so quiet, sensing that storm<br>
<br>
Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town<br>
They tell you that this rain can sting, and look down<br>
There is no blood around see no sign of pain<br>
No pain, seeing no red at all, see no rain<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just let the red rain splash you, let the rain fall on your skin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to you defences down with the trust of a child<br>
<br>
And I can't watch any more, no more denial<br>
It's so hard to lay down in all of this<br>

If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung.<br>
Would you hear my voice come through the music would you hold it near as it were your own.<br>
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken perhaps they're better left unsung.<br>
I don't know, don't really care let there be songs to fill the air.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripple in still water when there is no pebble tossed nor wind to blow<br>
<br>
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty if your cup is full may it be again.<br>
Let it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of men.<br>
There is a road, no simple highway between the dawn and the dark of night.<br>
And if you go no one may follow that path is for your steps alone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripple in still water...<br>

So she woke up, woke up from where she was, lyin' still, and said<br>
"I've got to do something about where we're goin'.<br>
Step on a steam train, step out of the driving rain maybe,<br>
run from the darkness in the night."<br>

Sweet the sin, bitter the taste in my mouth.<br>
I see seven towers, but I only see one way out.<br>
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking scream without raising your voice.<br>
You know I took the poison, from the poison stream then I floated out of here.<br>
<br>
She runs through the streets, with her eyes painted red under a black belly of cloud in the rain.<br>
In through a doorway she brings me white golden pearls stolen from the sea.<br>
She is ragin', she is raging and the storm blows up in her eyes.<br>
She will suffer the needle chill. She's running to stand still.<br>

Are you goin to Scarborough Fair? Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme<br>
Remember me to one who lives there she once was a true love of mine<br>
<br>
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt - On the side of a hill in the deep forest green<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground<br>
Without no seams nor needlework - Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine - Sleeps unaware of the clarion call<br>
<br>
Tell her to find me an acre of land - On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Washes the grave with silvery tears<br>
Between the salt water and the sea strands - A soldier cleans and polishes a gun<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>
<br>
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather - War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Generals order their soldiers to kill<br>
And gather it all in a bunch of heather - And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>

Got out of town on a boat goin to southern islands sailing a reach before a followin sea<br>
She was makin for the trades on the outside and the downhill run to Papeete Bay<br>
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas we got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way<br>
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you but on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about how many times I have fallen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits are using me, larger voices callin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been around the world lookin' for that woman, girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows love can endure and you know it will and you know it will<br>
<br>
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time you understand now why you came this way<br>
'Cause the truth you might be runnin from is so small but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day<br>
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dyin and my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain<br>
I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin she is all that I have left and music is her name<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
So we cheated and we lied and we tested and we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do<br>
You will survive being bested but somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you<br>
In the Southern Cross<br>

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

Once there was a river, now there's a stone.<br>
You know it's evil when you're living alone.<br>

Try to see it my way. Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on<br>
While you see it your way, run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone<br>
We can work it out<br>
<br>
Think of what you're saying. You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright<br>
Think of what I'm saying. We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight<br>
We can work it out<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always thought that it's a crime so I will ask you once again<br>
<br>
Try to see it my way only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong<br>
While you see it your way there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long<br>
We can work it out<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is very short...<br>

Been away, haven't seen you in a while. How've you been?<br>
Have you changed your style and do you think<br>
That we've grown up differently? Don't seem the same<br>
Seems you've lost your feel for me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's leave it alone, cause we can't see eye to eye.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There ain't no good guys, there ain't no bad guys.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's only you and me and we just disagree.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooo<br>
<br>
I'm going back to a place that's far away. How bout you?<br>
Have you got a place to stay? Why should I care?<br>
When I'm just trying to get along we were friends<br>
But now it's the end of our love song...<br>

I guess you wonder where I've been I searched to find the love within<br>
I came back to let you know got a thing for you and I can't let it go<br>
<br>
My friends wonder what is wrong with me, well I'm in a daze from your love you see<br>
I came back to let you know got a thing for you and I can't let it go<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people go around the world for love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they may never find what they dream of<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you won't do, you do for love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you tried everything but you don't give up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my world only you<br>

I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road<br>
Searching in the sun for another overload<br>
I hear you singing in the wires, I can hear you through the whine<br>
And the Wichita lineman.. is still on the line<br>
<br>
I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain<br>
And, if it snows, that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain<br>
And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time<br>
And the Wichita lineman...<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>

So, so you think you can tell, heaven from hell, blue skies from pain<br>
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil<br>
Do you think you can tell?<br>
<br>
Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change<br>
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage<br>
<br>
How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year<br>
Running over the same old ground what have we found<br>
the same old fears. Wish you were here<br>
