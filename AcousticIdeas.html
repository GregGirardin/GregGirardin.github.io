I read the news today, oh boy about a lucky man who made the grade<br>
And though the news was rather sad well, I just had to laugh<br>
I saw the photograph<br>
<br>
He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed<br>
A crowd of people stood and stared they'd seen his face before<br>
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords<br>
<br>
I saw a film today oh boy, the English Army had just won the war<br>
A crowd of people turned away but I just had to look<br>
Having read the book.. I'd love to turn you on<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed I was late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found my way upstairs and had a smoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and somebody spoke and I went into a dream<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhh..<br>
<br>
I read the news today oh boy, four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire<br>
And though the holes were rather small they had to count them all<br>
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall<br>
I'd love to turn you on<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that I could stay with you, for a while maybe longer if I do<br>
<br>
Don't you think the time is right for us to find.<br>
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time and can you see<br>
Which way we should turn together or alone?<br>
I can never see what's right or what is wrong<br>

Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way.<br>

If it's one of us, I'm sure we both will see<br>

Woo-hoo,woo-hoo<br>

Well my heart knows me better than I know myself so I'm gonna let it do all the talking.<br>
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere with a big black horse and a cherry tree.<br>
I felt a little fear upon my back I said "Don't look back, just keep on walking.<br>
When the big black horse said, "Look this way" He said, "Hey there baby, will you marry me?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I said no... I said, no, no, you're not the one for me<br>
<br>
And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours, so I stopped it dead for a beat or two.<br>
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it, and it won't forgive me after all these years<br>
So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere with a big black horse and a cherry tree.<br>
Now it won't come back, cause it's oh so happy and now I've got a hole for the world to see<br>

I feel so unsure as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor<br>
As the music dies, something in your eyes<br>
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it's easy to pretend I know your not a fool<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should've known better than to cheat a friend and waste the chance that I've been given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you<br>
<br>
Time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend<br>
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind<br>
There's no comfort in the truth pain is all you'll find<br>
<br>
Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd<br>
Maybe it's better this way we'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say<br>
We could have been so good together we could have lived this dance forever<br>
But no one's gonna dance with me, please stay<br>
<br>
Now that you're gone<br>

I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and<br>
He walked with a purpose<br>
In his sneakers, down the street<br>
He had many questions like children often do, he said:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me am I very far<br>

Must've been late afternoon<br>
on our way the sun broke free of the clouds<br>
We count only blue cars<br>
Skip the cracks in the street<br>
And ask many questions like children often do, we said:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God cause I'd really like to meet her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask her why we're who we are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God cause I'm on my way to see her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me am I very far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I very far now?<br>

It's getting cold, picked up the pace.<br>
How our shoes make hard noises in this place.<br>
Our clothes are stained<br>
We pass many cross-eyed people<br>
And ask many questions like children often do<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice.<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are?<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>
<br>
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>

I just can't waste the time I must keep dry<br>
Got to stop believin' in all your lies<br>
Cause I got to much to do before I die<br>
<br>
Don't get too lost in all I say<br>
If half the time I really felt that way<br>
That was then and now it's today<br>
Can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay<br>
Before someone comes along and takes my place<br>
With a different name and yes a different face<br>

Get up, get out, get out of the door<br>
Your playin' cold music on the barroom floor<br>
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.<br>
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town<br>
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire! Fire on the mountain!<br>

Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat<br>
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat.<br>
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat<br>
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete.<br>
If Mercy's a bus'ness, I wish it for you<br>
More than just ashes when your dreams come true.<br>

Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door.<br>

You gave all you had. Why you wanna give more?<br>
The more that you give, the more it will take<br>
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake.<br>

On the first part of the journey I was lookin at all the life<br>

The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it felt good to be out of the rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the desert you can remember your name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la<br>
<br>
After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground and the perfect disguise above<br>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

Bright and early for their daily races going nowhere<br>
Their tears are filling up their glasses no expression<br>
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow no tomorrow<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I find it kinda funny I find it kinda sad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreams in which I'm dying are the best Ive ever had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When people run in circles it's a very very.. mad world<br>
<br>
Children waiting for the day they feel good, happy birthday<br>
Made to feel the way that every child should, sit and listen<br>
Went to school and I was very nervous, no one knew me<br>
Hello teacher tell me whats my lesson, look right through me<br>

I am a man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble all my days<br>
I bid farewell to old Kentucky the place where I was born and raised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he was born and raised<br>
<br>
For six long years I've been in trouble no pleasure here on Earth I found<br>
For in this world I'm bound to ramble I have no friends to help me now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no friends to help him now<br>
<br>
It's fare-thee-well my old true lover I never expect to see you again<br>
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad perhaps I'll die upon this train<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps he'll die upon this train<br>
<br>
Harmonica IV<br>
<br>
You can bury me in some deep valley for many years where I may lay<br>
And you may learn to love another while I am sleeping in my grave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While he is sleeping in his grave<br>
<br>
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger my face you never will see no more<br>
But there is one promise that is given I'll meet you on God's golden shore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll meet you on God's golden shore<br>

I once had a girl, or should I say she once had me<br>
She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked my to stay and told me to sit anywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair<br>
<br>
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>
<br>
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird has flown<br>
So I lit a fire, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>

The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Break * (vocal comes in near the end of the break)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing, one thing leads to another..<br>
<br>
Then it's easy to believe, somebody's been lying to me<br>
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>

I cannot make a single sound as you scream<br>
It can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch<br>
We touch, this place is so quiet, sensing that storm<br>
<br>
Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town<br>
They tell you that this rain can sting, and look down<br>
There is no blood around see no sign of pain<br>
No pain, seeing no red at all, see no rain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just let the red rain splash you, let the rain fall on your skin<br>

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty if your cup is full may it be again.<br>
Let it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of men.<br>
There is a road, no simple highway between the dawn and the dark of night.<br>

She runs through the streets, with her eyes painted red under a black belly of cloud in the rain.<br>

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt - On the side of a hill in the deep forest green<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground<br>
Without no seams nor needlework - Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine - Sleeps unaware of the clarion call<br>
<br>
Tell her to find me an acre of land - On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Washes the grave with silvery tears<br>
Between the salt water and the sea strands - A soldier cleans and polishes a gun<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>
<br>
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather - War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme - Generals order their soldiers to kill<br>
And gather it all in a bunch of heather - And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>

Got out of town on a boat goin to southern islands sailing a reach before a followin sea<br>
She was makin for the trades on the outside and the downhill run to Papeete Bay<br>
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas we got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way<br>
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you but on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about how many times I have fallen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits are using me, larger voices callin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been around the world lookin' for that woman, girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows love can endure and you know it will and you know it will<br>
<br>
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time you understand now why you came this way<br>
'Cause the truth you might be runnin from is so small but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day<br>
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dyin and my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain<br>
I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin she is all that I have left and music is her name<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

Under blue moon I saw you so soon you'll take me<br>
Up in your arms too late to beg you or cancel it though I know it must be<br>
The killing time, unwillingly mine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate, up against your will, through the thick and thin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He will wait until you give yourself to him<br>

In starlit nights I saw you, so cruelly you kissed me<br>
Your lips a magic world, your sky all hung with jewels<br>
The killing moon, will come too soon<br>

Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty the sound of their voice fades with the light<br>
I think about the loveless fascination under the Milky Way tonight<br>

Lower the curtains down on Memphis lower the curtains down alright<br>
I've got no time for private consultation under the Milky Way tonight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish I knew what you were looking for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might have known what you would find<br>

And it's something quite peculiar something that's shimmering and white<br>
It leads you here despite your destination under the Milky Way tonight<br>

High and dry in the long hot day.<br>
Lost and lonely in every way.<br>
Got the flats all around, sky up above.<br>
Yes I need a little water of love.<br>

I've been too long lonely and my heart feels pain.<br>
Crying out for some soothing rain.<br>
I believe I've taken enough.<br>
Yes I need a little water of love.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Water of love deep in the ground<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But there ain't no water here to be found.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some day baby when the river runs free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's gonna carry that water of love to me.<br>

There's a bird up in a tree sitting up high.<br>
