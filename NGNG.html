Tell me do you think it'd be all right, if I could just crash here tonight<br>
You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go<br>
And you know it might not be that bad, you were the best I'd ever had<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is gone but something might be found to take its place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey jealousy..<br>
<br>
And you can trust me not to think and not to sleep around<br>
If you don't expect too much from me you might not be let down<br>
Cause all I really want is to be with you feeling like I matter too<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

Roseanna's dady had a car she loved to drive,<br>
Stole the keys one night and took me for a ride.<br>
Turned up the music just as loud as it could go,<br>
Blew out the speakers in her daddy's radio.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was shakin' (oh) Snappin her fingers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was moving round and round. That girl was shakin<br>
<br>
We started drinkin' want to take it straight<br>
She was doin' 80 and she slammed on the brakes.<br>
We got so high we had to pull to the side,<br>
We did some shakin' till the middle of the night!<br>

Three cups of coffee but I can't clear my head from what went down last night<br>

You hear me talk but you don't hear what I say I guess it don't even matter<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue mornin blue day won't you see things my way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue mornin can't you see what your love has done to me<br>

I've always listened to your point of view my ways I've tried to mend<br>
And I've always been a patient man but my patience has reached its end<br>
You tell me you're leaving you tell me goodbye you say you might send a letter<br>
Well honey don't telephone cause I won't be alone I'll need someone to make me feel better<br>

On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha<br>
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song<br>
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before<br>
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do<br>
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' there to do<br>
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I am on the road again there I am on the stage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I go playin' star again there I go turn the page<br>
<br>
Well you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road<br>
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold<br>
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode<br>
Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can<br>
All the same old cliches, "Is it woman, is it man?"<br>
And you always seem outnumbered so you don't dare make a stand<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away<br>
Every ounce of energy you try to give away<br>
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play<br>
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed<br>
With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head<br>
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said<br>

Well&nbsp;&nbsp;we were just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet<br>
Playin all the bars, sleepin' in our cars And we practiced right on out in the street<br>
No, we didn't have much money we barely made enough to survive<br>
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play, people came alive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock and roll band, everybody's waitin, gettin crazy, anticipating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love and music, play..<br>
<br>
Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis we were getting pretty good at the game<br>
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name<br>
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing<br>
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.<br>
<br>
Playin for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night<br>
He smoked a big cigar, drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight<br>
Sign a record company contract you know I've got great expectations<br>
When I hear you on the car radio you're goin' to be a sensation!"<br>

One man washed up on an empty beach, one man betrayed with a kiss<br>

Josie's on a vacation far away come around and talk it over<br>
So many things that I wanna to say you know I like my girls a little bit older<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wanna use your love tonight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't wanna lose your love tonight<br>
<br>
I ain't got many friends left to talk to<br>
No-one's around when I'm in trouble<br>
You know I'd do anything for you<br>
Stay the night, we'll keep it under cover<br>

I hold on so nervously to me and my drink I wish it was coolin' me<br>
But so far has not been good it's been shitty, and I feel awkward as I should<br>
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing since I thought of you and me<br>
Well I am imagining a dark lit place or your place, or my place<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna make you move because you're standin' still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If your body matches what your eyes can do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll probably move right through me on my way to you<br>
<br>
I hold out for one more drink before I think I'm lookin too desperately<br>
But so far has not been fun I should just stay home if one thing really means one<br>
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks, that would be cool with me<br>
Well I'm still imagining a dark lit place or your place, or my place<br>

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br>
I said don't mind but what do you mean, I am the one<br>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.<br>
Then ev'ry head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,<br>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mother always told me, be careful who you love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And be careful what you do, cause the lie becomes the truth, hey<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the kid is not my son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
<br>
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side<br>
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans<br>
Cause we danced on the floor in the round.<br>
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice<br>
<br>
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me<br>
Then showed a photo. My baby cried. His eyes were like mine.<br>
Can we dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey<br>

I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind<br>
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
And I feel there is nothing I can do, oh yeah<br>
<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you<br>
I really don't mind what happens now and then<br>
As long as you'll be my friend at the end<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'm alive and well will you be there a holding my hand?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might<br>

You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep<br>
You took for granted all the times I never let you down<br>

I picked you up and put you back on solid ground<br>

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean<br>
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen<br>
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies<br>
Knockin' me out with those American thighs<br>
<br>
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,<br>
She told me to come, but I was already there<br>
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shook me all night long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you shook me all night long<br>
<br>
Working double time on the seduction line<br>
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine<br>
Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>
<br>
Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,<br>
Now I'm back in the ring to take a-nother swing<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

You see em comin at you every night strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight<br>
You know their business, you think it's a bore, they make you restless it's nothin' you ain't seen before<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Get around town, spend your time on the run you never let down, say you do it for fun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never miss a play, though you make quite a few you give it all away - everybody wants you<br>

You crave attention, you can never say "no" throw your affections any way the wind blows<br>
You always make it you're on top of the scene you sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br>

Nights of confusion and impossible dreams days at the mirror patchin up around the seams<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you understand seems the more like you do you never get away... everybody wants you<br>

Once upon a time, not so long ago<br>
<br>
Tommy used to work on the docks union's been on strike<br>
He's down on his luck it's tough, so tough<br>
Gina works the diner all day working for her man,<br>
she brings home her pay for love, for love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She says we've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got each other and that's a lot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For love, we'll give it a shot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whooah, we're half way there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whooah, livin' on a prayer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take my hand and we'll make it I swear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whooah, livin' on a prayer<br>
<br>
Tommy's got his six string in hock bow he's holding in what he used<br>
To make it talk so tough, it's tough<br>
Gina dreams of running away when she cries in the night<br>
Tommy whispers: "Baby it's okay, someday"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got to hold on..<br>
<br>
Solo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got to hold on, ready or not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You live for the fight when that's all that you've got<br>

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway<br>
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway<br>

 as you falter down to the ground<br>
And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oh you were flying oh so high<br>
<br>
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer<br>
Yeah they hear you calling home<br>
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us<br>
But you left me far behind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad but I did it anyway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had but you couldn't share the pain<br>
<br>
No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;won't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind<br>

Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit<br>

A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume<br>
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows searching in the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding, somewhere in the night<br>

Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill<br>
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time<br>
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loves the night scene, bar queen, just living for the fun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking over every dance floor like she's the only one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spotlight, all night, kissing everyone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you never pull it out (So much cuter)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With something in your mouth!<br>

Hey..<br>

Won't you come see about me? I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby<br>
Tell me your troubles and doubts giving me everything inside and out and<br>
Love's strange so real in the dark think of the tender things that we were working on<br>
Slow change may pull us apart when the light gets into your heart, baby<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you forget about me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you stand above me? Look my way, never love me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you recognise me? Call my name or walk on by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down.<br>

Don't you try to pretend it's my feeling we'll win in the end<br>

Going to take you apart I'll put us back together at heart baby<br>

Another day, some other way<br>
We're gonna go, but then we'll see you again<br>

I hear the drums echoing tonight she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation<br>
She's coming in twelve thirty flight, the moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salvation<br>
I stopped an old man along the way hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies<br>
He turned to me as if to say "hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gonna take some time to do the things we never had.<br>
<br>
Ooo<br>

The wild dogs cry out in the night as they grow restless longing for some solitary company<br>

I seek to cure what's deep inside frightened of this thing that I've become<br>

Here we stand worlds apart, hearts broken in two<br>
Sleepless nights losing ground I'm reaching for you<br>
Feeling that it's gone can change your mind<br>
If we can't go on to survive the tide love divides<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Someday love will find you break those chains that bind you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One night will remind you how we touched and went our separate ways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If he ever hurts you true love won't desert you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I still love you though we touched and went our separate ways<br>
<br>
Troubled times caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain<br>
Distant eyes promises we made were in vain, vain, vain<br>
If you must go, I wish you love you'll never walk alone<br>
Take care my love miss you love<br>
