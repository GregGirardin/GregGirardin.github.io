Tell me do you think it'd be all right, if I could just crash here tonight<br>
You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go<br>
And you know it might not be that bad, you were the best I'd ever had<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is gone but something might be found to take its place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey jealousy..<br>
<br>
And you can trust me not to think and not to sleep around<br>
If you don't expect too much from me you might not be let down<br>
Cause all I really want is to be with you feeling like I matter too<br>
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah. Me and my baby in '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of '69, yeah.<br>

Jessie is a friend yeah I know, he's been a good friend of mine<br>
But lately something's changed, it ain't hard to define<br>
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's watchin him with those eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's lovin him with that body, I just know it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he's holdin her in his arms, late late at night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Y'know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I find a woman like that?<br>
<br>
I'll play along with the charade<br>
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change<br>
Y'know I feel so dirty when they start talkin cute<br>
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm lookin in the mirror all the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondrin what she don't see in me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah I've been funny I've been cool with the lines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?<br>
<br>
Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?<br>

Here comes the jesters, one, two three<br>
It's all part of my fantasy<br>
I love the music and I love to see the crowd<br>
Dancin in the aisles and singin' out loud<br>
<br>
Here comes the dancers one by one<br>
Your mama's callin but you're havin fun<br>
You find you're dancin on a number nine cloud<br>
Put your hands together now and sing It out loud<br>

Reachin for the sky and churn in up the ground<br>

It's early morning, the sun comes out last night was shaking and pretty loud<br>
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin so what is wrong with another sin?<br>
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell so give her inches and feed her well<br>
More days to come, new places to go I've got to leave, it's time for a show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I am rock you like a hurricane<br>
<br>
My body is burning, it starts to shout desire is coming, it breaks out loud<br>
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose just have to make it with someone I choose<br>
The night is calling, I have to go the wolf is hungry, he runs the show<br>
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win on the hunt tonight for love at first sting<br>

But that'll change if she'd ever find out about you and I<br>
O, but her love is cold it wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cuz<br>

Backstroke lover always hidin neath the cover, still I talked to your daddy he say,<br>
He said you ain't seen nothing til you're down on a muffin, then you're sure to be changin your ways.<br>
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder, all the times I can reminisce<br>
Cause the best thing lovin with her sister and her cousin only started with a little kiss, like this!<br>
<br>
See-saw swingin with the boys in the school and your feet flyin up in the air,<br>
Singin hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle, you be swingin like you just didn't care<br>
So I took a big chance at the high school dance with a missy who was ready to play<br>
Was it me she was foolin cause she knew what she was doin and I know love was here to stay<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When she told me to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk this way.. ah, just give me a kiss (solo) like this!<br>
<br>
School girl Sadie with the classy, kinda sassy, little skirt climbing way up her knees.<br>
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker when I noticed they was lookin at me.<br>
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady till the boys told me something I missed<br>
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor so I gave her just a little kiss, like this!<br>
<br>
See-saw swingin..<br>

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br>
I said don't mind but what do you mean, I am the one<br>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.<br>
Then ev'ry head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,<br>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mother always told me, be careful who you love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And be careful what you do, cause the lie becomes the truth, hey<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the kid is not my son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
<br>
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side<br>
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans<br>
Cause we danced on the floor in the round.<br>
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice<br>
<br>
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me<br>
Then showed a photo. My baby cried. His eyes were like mine.<br>
Can we dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey<br>

I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind<br>
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
And I feel there is nothing I can do, oh yeah<br>
<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you<br>
I really don't mind what happens now and then<br>
As long as you'll be my friend at the end<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'm alive and well will you be there a holding my hand?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might<br>

You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep<br>

I picked you up and put you back on solid ground<br>

Well&nbsp;&nbsp;we were just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet<br>
Playin all the bars, sleepin' in our cars And we practiced right on out in the street<br>
No, we didn't have much money we barely made enough to survive<br>
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play, people came alive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock and roll band, everybody's waitin, gettin crazy, anticipating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love and music, play..<br>
<br>
Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis we were getting pretty good at the game<br>
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name<br>
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing<br>
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.<br>
<br>
Playin for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night<br>
He smoked a big cigar, drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight<br>
Sign a record company contract you know I've got great expectations<br>
When I hear you on the car radio you're goin' to be a sensation!"<br>

She's got a smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky<br>
Now and then when I see her face she takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet child of mine / love of mine<br>
<br>
She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and rain to quietly pass me by<br>

I don't know where I'm going, but I sure know where I've been.<br>
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday.<br>
And I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time, here I go again.<br>
<br>
Though I keep searching for an answer, I never seem to find what I'm looking for.<br>
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause I know what it means, to walk along, the lonely street of dreams.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here I go again on my own, going down the only road I've ever known.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a drifter I was born to walk alone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time.<br>
<br>
I'm just another heart in need of rescue, waiting on love's sweet charity.<br>
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days,<br>

Well I got good news, she's a real good liar<br>
Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire<br>

I pulled into town in a police car<br>
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far<br>
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied<br>
You can't catch me cause the rabbit done died, yes it did<br>
<br>
You stand in the front just a shakin your ass<br>
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass<br>
I'll talk about something you can sure understand<br>
Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand<br>

This club has got to be the most pretentious thing since I thought of you and me<br>
Well I am imagining a dark lit place or your place, or my place<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna make you move because you're standin' still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If your body matches what your eyes can do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll probably move right through me on my way to you<br>
<br>
I hold out for one more drink before I think I'm lookin too desperately<br>
But so far has not been fun I should just stay home if one thing really means one<br>
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks, that would be cool with me<br>
Well I'm still imagining a dark lit place or your place, or my place<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the bushes, till I'm screamin for more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the basement, lock the cellar door, and baby talk dirty to me<br>
<br>
You know I call you, I call you on the telephone<br>
I'm only hoping that you're home, so I can hear you<br>
When you say those words to me, and whisper so softly<br>
I gotta hear you Cause baby we'll be<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the drive-in..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down<br>
all inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town<br>
feel as though nobody cares if I live or die<br>
so I might as well begin to put some action in my life<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the law...<br>
<br>
So much for the golden future, I can't even start<br>
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart<br>
You don't know what's it like, you don't have a clue<br>
If you did you'd find yourself doing the same thing too<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the law..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't know what it's like<br>
