If you're havin trouble with the high school head he's givin you the blues (w/ ha)<br>
You wanna graduate but not in his bed, here's what you gotta do<br>
Pick up the phone I'm always home call me any time<br>
Just ring 362436 oh I lead a life of crime<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspDirty deeds, done dirt cheap x 3 / Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap x 2<br>
<br>
You've got problems in your life of love, you got a broken heart<br>
He's double dealin with your best friend, that's when the teardrops start fella<br>
Pick up the phone I'm here alone, I'll make a social call<br>
Come right in forget 'bout him we'll have ourselves a ball<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Solo<br>
<br>
If you got a lady and you want her gone but you ain't got the guts<br>
She keeps naggin at you night and day, enough to drive you nuts<br>
Pick up the phone leave her alone, it's time you made a stand<br>
For a fee I'm happy to be your back door man hey<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspConcrete shoes, cyanide, TNT - Done Dirt Cheap<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNeck ties, contracts, high voltage - Done Dirty Cheap<br>
<br>
Dirty deeds, do anything you want me to<br>

Baby, here I am I'm the man on the scene<br>
I can give you what you want but you gotta come home with me<br>
I have got some good old lovin' and I got some more in store<br>
When I get through throwin' it on you You gotta come back for more<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspBoys and things that come by the dozen<br>
&nbsp&nbspThat ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'<br>
&nbsp&nbspPretty little thing let me light your candle<br>
&nbsp&nbsp'Cause mama I'm so hard to handle now, yes, I am<br>
<br>
Action speaks louder than words and I'm a man of great experience<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>

Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStandin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMan we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>

And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>

&nbsp&nbspStanding on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>

On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha<br>
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song<br>
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before<br>
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do<br>
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' there to do<br>
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through<br>
<br>
  Here I am on the road again there I am on the stage<br>
  Here I go playin' star again there I go turn the page<br>
<br>
Well you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road<br>
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold<br>
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode<br>
Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can<br>
All the same old cliches, "Is it woman, is it man?"<br>
And you always seem outnumbered so you don't dare make a stand<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away<br>
Every ounce of energy you try to give away<br>
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play<br>
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed<br>
With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head<br>
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said<br>

Well  we were just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet<br>
Playin all the bars, sleepin' in our cars And we practiced right on out in the street<br>
No, we didn't have much money we barely made enough to survive<br>
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play, people came alive. <br>

  Rock and roll band, everybody's waitin, gettin crazy, anticipating<br>
  Love and music, play..<br>
 <br>
Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis we were getting pretty good at the game<br>
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name<br>
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing<br>
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.<br>
 <br>
Playin for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night<br>
He smoked a big cigar, drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight<br>

When I hear you on the car radio you're goin' to be a sensation!"<br>

&nbsp&nbspPeople always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd mother always told me, be careful who you love,<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd be careful what you do, cause the lie becomes the truth, hey<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBillie Jean is not my lover<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut the kid is not my son<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
<br>
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side<br>
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans<br>
Cause we danced on the floor in the round.<br>
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice<br>
<br>
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me<br>
Then showed a photo. My baby cried. His eyes were like mine.<br>
Can we dance on the floor in the round?<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspPeople always told me, be careful what you do.<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
&nbsp&nbspBut you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThis happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey<br>

Backstroke lover always hidin neath the cover, still I talked to your daddy he say,<br>
He said you ain’t seen nothing til you’re down on a muffin, then you’re sure to be changin your ways.<br>
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder, all the times I can reminisce<br>
Cause the best thing lovin with her sister and her cousin only started with a little kiss, like this!<br>
<br>
See-saw swingin with the boys in the school and your feet flyin up in the air,<br>
Singin hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle, you be swingin like you just didn’t care<br>
So I took a big chance at the high school dance with a missy who was ready to play<br>
Was it me she was foolin cause she knew what she was doin and I know love was here to stay<br>
<br>
  When she told me to<br>
  Walk this way.. ah, just give me a kiss (solo) like this!<br>

School girl Sadie with the classy, kinda sassy, little skirt climbing way up her knees.<br>
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker when I noticed they was lookin at me.<br>
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady till the boys told me something I missed<br>
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor so I gave her just a little kiss, like this!<br>

You're calling my name but I gotta make clear<br>
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year<br>

Said my get up and go must've got up and went<br>
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar<br>
Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire<br>

  Sweet emotion...<br>

Your daddy said I took it just a little too far<br>
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied<br>
You can't catch me cause the rabbit done died, yes it did<br>
<br>
You stand in the front just a shakin your ass<br>
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspPlenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspThey living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

Tommy's got his six string in hock bow he's holding in what he used<br>
To make it talk so tough, it's tough<br>

And she won't give up cause she's seventeen<br>
She's a frozen fire she's my one desire<br>

  I don't want to hold her down don't want to break her crown<br>
  When she says, "Let's go"<br>
  I like the nightlife baby<br>
  She says, "I like the nightlife baby"<br>

She's laughing inside cause they can't refuse<br>
She's so beautiful now she doesn't wear her shoes<br>
She never likes to choose<br>

She's got wonderful eyes and a risqué mouth<br>
And when I asked her before she said she's holding out<br>
She's a frozen fire, she's my one desire<br>

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway<br>
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway<br>
And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble<br>
 as you falter down to the ground<br>
And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying<br>
&nbsp&nbspoh you were flying oh so high<br>
<br>
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer<br>
Yeah they hear you calling home<br>
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us<br>
But you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspNow maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad but I did it anyway<br>
&nbsp&nbspNow maybe some would say you're left with what you had but you couldn't share the pain<br>
<br>
No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown<br>
&nbsp&nbspwon't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind<br>

Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene<br>
Put his ear to the wall, and like a distant scream<br>
He heard one guitar just blew him away<br>
Saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day<br>
 <br>
Bought a beat up six-string in a second hand store<br>
Didn't know how to play it but he knew for sure<br>
That that one guitar felt good in his hands<br>
Didn't take long to understand<br>
Just one guitar slung way down low<br>
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go<br>

  So he started rockin, ain't never gonna stop<br>
  Gotta keep on rockin, someday he's gonna make it to the top<br>

Hey, baby, if you're feelin' down,<br>
I know what's good for you all day.<br>
Are you worried what your friends see?<br>
Will it ruin your reputation lovin' me? <br>
<br>
  Cause I'm a dirty white boy<br>
  Yeah a dirty white boy<br>
  A dirty white boy.<br>
<br>
Don't drive no big black car,<br>
Don't like no Hollywood movie star.<br>
You want me to be true to ya,<br>
You don't give a damn what I do to ya<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
I've been in trouble since I don't know when,<br>
I'm in trouble now and I know somehow I'll find trouble again.<br>
I'm a loner, but I'm never alone,<br>
Every night I get one step closer to the danger zone<br>
<br>
