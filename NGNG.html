For a fee I'm happy to be your back door man hey<br>

&nbsp&nbspI'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded<br>
<br>
You don't have to read my mind to know what I have in mind<br>
Honey you oughta know,<br>
Now you move so fine, let me lay it on the line<br>
I wanna know what you're doin' after the show<br>

If it feels alright, maybe you can stay all night<br>
Should I leave you my key?<br>
But you've got to give me a sign, come on girl, some kind of sign<br>
Tell me, are you hot mama? You sure look that way to me<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspAre you old enough? will you be ready when I call your bluff?<br>
&nbsp&nbspIs my timing right? did you save your love for me tonight?<br>

Turned up the music just as loud as it could go,<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStandin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMan we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStanding on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

<div class='panel'>
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha<br>
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song<br>
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before<br>
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do<br>
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' there to do<br>
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspHere I am on the road again<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere I am on the stage<br>
&nbsp&nbspHere I go playin' star again<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere I go turn the page<br>
<br>
Well you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road<br>
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold<br>
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode<br>
Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can<br>
All the same old cliches, "Is it woman, is it man?"<br>
And you always seem outnumbered so you don't dare make a stand<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away<br>
Every ounce of energy you try to give away<br>
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play<br>
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed<br>
With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head<br>
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said<br>

Oh they do respect her but they love to watch her strut<br>

Sometimes they'll want to leave her just give up and leave her<br>
But they would never play that scene in spite of all her talking<br>
Once she starts in walking the lady will be all they ever dreamed<br>

Well&nbsp&nbspwe were just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet<br>
Playin all the bars, sleepin' in our cars And we practiced right on out in the street<br>

But when we got up on stage and got ready to play, people came alive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspRock and roll band, everybody's waitin, gettin crazy, anticipating<br>
&nbsp&nbspLove, and music, play, play, play, yeah...<br>

Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis we were getting pretty good at the game<br>
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name<br>
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing<br>
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.<br>
<br>
Playin' for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night<br>
He smoked a big cigar, Drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight<br>

Working double time on the seduction line<br>

Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>

Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,<br>

I've got you on the loose I left you groovin'<br>
I've got you on the beat I left you broken<br>
But won't you take my place since long ago I wandered<br>
Way out on a cliff with the brilliance of an angel<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspSo fly me courageous<br>
<br>
Mother America is brandishing her weapons<br>
She keeps me safe and warm by threats and misconceptions<br>
So if you break the chains you'll have to shake me<br>
And if you break my heart you'll have to take me<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWhoa lady won't you take it easy push, me, out, of<br>
&nbsp&nbspSo fly me courageous<br>
<br>
I heard your whispers from the bottom of the canyon<br>
It's not so hard to hide the rattlesnakes confusion<br>
Wrap me high in the sky circle me with stallions<br>
She flew from peak to peak with the freedom of an eagle<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspSo fly me courageous<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspPlenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspThey living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

Strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight<br>
You know their business, you think it's a bore<br>
They make you restless, it's nothin' you ain't seen before<br>
Get around town, spend your time on the run<br>
You never let down, say you do it for fun<br>
Never miss a play, though you make quite a few<br>
You give it all away - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
You crave attention, you can never say "no"<br>
Throw your affections any way the wind blows<br>
You always make it, you're on top of the scene<br>
You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br>
Puttin' on the eyes 'til there's nobody else<br>
You never realize what you do to yourself<br>
The things that they see make the daily reviews<br>
You never get free - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
  Everybody knows you<br>
  Everybody snows you<br>
  Everybody leads you, needs you, bleeds you<br>
<br>
Nights of confusion and impossible dreams<br>
Days at the mirror, patchin' up around the seams<br>
You got your glory, you paid for it all<br>
You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol<br>
Say goodbye to conventional ways<br>
You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days<br>
The more you understand, seems the more like you do<br>
You never get away - everybody wants you<br>

<button class='accordion'>12. Far Behind</button>
<div class='panel'>
Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway<br>
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway<br>
And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble<br>
 as you falter down to the ground<br>
And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying<br>
&nbsp&nbspoh you were flying oh so high<br>
<br>
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer<br>
Yeah they hear you calling home<br>
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us<br>
But you left me far behind<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspNow maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad but I did it anyway<br>
&nbsp&nbspNow maybe some would say you're left with what you had but you couldn't share the pain<br>
<br>
No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer<br>
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known<br>
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown<br>
&nbsp&nbspwon't you look at where we've gone<br>
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind<br>
&nbsp&nbspas you trip the final line<br>
And that cold day when you lost control shame you left my life so soon<br>
&nbsp&nbspyou should have told me but you left me far behind<br>

Yeah, they hold you down gold you down<br>
