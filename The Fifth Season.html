I don't mind you coming here wasting all my time<br>
Cause when you're standing oh so near I kind of lose my mind<br>
It's not the perfume that you wear it's not the ribbons in your hair<br>
I don't mind you coming here and wasting all my time<br>
<br>
I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep<br>
It doesn't matter where you've been as long as it was deep, yeah<br>
You always knew to wear it well and you look so fancy I can tell<br>
I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you're just what I needed, I needed someone to feed/bleed<br>

All the commotion, the kiddie-like play<br>
It has people talking, talking<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>

The dark of the alley, the breaking of day<br>
Head while I'm driving, I'm driving<br>
Soft lips are open, them knuckles are pale<br>
Feels like you're dying, you're dying<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumed, with what's just transpired<br>
<br>
Hot as a fever, rattle of bones<br>
I could just taste it, taste it<br>
If this not forever, if this just tonight<br>
Oh we're still the greatest, the greatest, the greatest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner<br>
Sometimes I feel like my only friend<br>
Is the city I live in, the city of angels<br>
Lonely as I am, together we cry<br>
<br>
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion<br>
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am<br>
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy<br>
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't ever want to feel like I did that day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take me to the place I love, take me all the way<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Take me to the place I love, take me all the way<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there<br>
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone<br>
At least I have her love, the city she loves me<br>
Lonely as I am, together we cry<br>

Mr. Action, the king of misdirection,<br>
a master of deception,<br>
wears his mask so well<br>
Redefining what it means<br>
to be an extra on the scene.<br>
He's died a thousand times for you me.<br>
<br>
People wonder where he derives his power.<br>
Some think the he's a charmer<br>
Others think he’s the cat's-paw<br>
Always keeps close by<br>
Holds the tower in his eyes<br>
Because he knows that the story never dies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your bow Mr. Action<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no question, this one's for you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been a long time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been a wild ride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But you always see it through<br>
<br>
He's a mystic. Oh you know he's cryptic<br>
You think you caught a glimpse but you just missed it<br>
Lavender sachet<br>
a little luck along the way<br>
And he knows just how to handle any fate.<br>
<br>
An ocarina of ancient blue patina<br>
He plays a song from deep beyond the real world<br>
She says you'll never know yourself,<br>
til you dress like someone else<br>
Sorting out the stories that you will tell<br>

Watch that snow fall on the remains of our youth<br>
Just pull me in and don't let loose<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>

Wonder if I'm ever gonna go find my truth<br>
Wonder if we were born to see this through<br>
How could we let the seasons choose?<br>
When you're the only one I ever belonged to<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like help won't save us with our trouble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I just need some love forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After all<br>
<br>
I wanna get lost, I wanna get loud with you<br>
And when I get low, I wanna get high with you<br>
Watch that snow fall on the remains of our youth<br>
Just pull me in and don't let loose<br>

<button class='accordion css_medleyEnd'>11. Franklin's Tower</button>
<div class='panel'>
In another time's forgotten space<br>
Your eyes looked from your mother's face<br>
Wildflower seed on the sand and stone<br>
May the four winds blow you safely home<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll away the dew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll away the dew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll away the dew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll away the dew<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell<br>
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell<br>
It can ring, turn night to day<br>
It can ring like fire when you lose your way<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
God save the child who rings that bell<br>
It may have one good ring, baby, you can't tell<br>
One watch by night, one watch by day<br>
If you get confused, listen to the music play<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Some come to laugh their past away<br>
Some come to make it just one more day<br>
Whichever way your pleasure tends<br>
If you plant ice, you're gonna harvest wind<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
In Franklin's tower the four winds sleep<br>
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep<br>
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind<br>
May the four winds blow you home again<br>
<br>

Hey, do it now<br>
<br>
Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>

This is the story of a poet I know<br>
He takes it easy and he talks real slow<br>
They call him lazy but when push comes to shove<br>
Lazy goes crazy for a real hard luck<br>
Dirty jeans and a whiskey robe he whispers<br>
Quote the raven nevermore<br>
The poet sat back with his whiskey pouring<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Bridge]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and he says<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he says<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't groove in the middle of my love connection<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been waiting all night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to move and stand in my direction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't groove in the middle of my love connection<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to move and stand in my direction<br>

<br>
I love sweet nectar above she's either<br>
Queen of the mean or she's as sweet as a dove<br>
Be careful to choose the words you say<br>
You'll be getting hotter every single way<br>
Lazy knew what he had to do<br>
But all the other poets were covered in tape<br>
