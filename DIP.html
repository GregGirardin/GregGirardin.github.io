You see em comin at you every night strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight<br>
You know their business, you think it's a bore, they make you restless it's nothin' you ain't seen before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get around town, spend your time on the run you never let down, say you do it for fun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never miss a play, though you make quite a few you give it all away - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
You crave attention, you can never say "no" throw your affections any way the wind blows<br>
You always make it you're on top of the scene you sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Puttin on the eyes til there's nobody else you never realize what you do to yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that they see make the daily reviews you never get free - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows you, everybody snows you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody leads you, needs you, bleeds you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
(Extra riff)<br>
<br>
Nights of confusion and impossible dreams days at the mirror patchin up around the seams<br>
You got your glory you paid for it all you take your pension in loneliness and alcohol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say goodbye to conventional ways you can't escape the hours you lose track of the days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you understand seems the more like you do you never get away... everybody wants you<br>

Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town<br>
I turn my back and you're messin' around<br>

But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do<br>
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through<br>

<button class='accordion'>5. Mama's Broken Heart</button>
<div class='panel'>
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors<br>
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops<br>
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver<br>
Don't know what I did next, all I know, I couldn't stop<br>
<br>
Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists<br>
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook<br>
I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it<br>
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and fix your makeup girl, it's just a breakup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you fall apart, but this ain't my mama's broken heart<br>
<br>
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic<br>
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames<br>
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches<br>
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame<br>
<br>
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation<br>
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make<br>
My mama came from a softer generation<br>
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
Powder your nose, paint your toes line your lips and keep 'em closed<br>
Cross your legs, dot your I's, and never let 'em see you cry<br>

<button class='accordion'>6. What I got</button>
<div class='panel'>
D G<br>
<br>
Early in the morning, risin' to the street. Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet.<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high. I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.<br>
<br>
Life is too short so love the one you got. Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same. Livin with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>

A Bm D A<br>
<br>
Twenty-five years and my life is still<br>
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope for a destination<br>
I realized quickly when I knew I should<br>
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man, for whatever that means<br>
<br>
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed<br>
Just to get it all out, what's in my head and I am feeling a little peculiar<br>
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside<br>
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and I scream at the top of my lungs "What's going on?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I said "Hey.." I said "Hey, what's going on?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooh, Ooh Ooh<br>
<br>
And I try, oh my God do I try, I try all the time, in this institution<br>
And I pray, oh my god do I pray I pray every single day for a revolution<br>

Made a wrong turn once or twice dug my way out, blood and fire<br>
Bad decisions, that's alright, welcome to my silly life<br>
<br>
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood miss No-Way-It's-All-Good<br>
It didn't slow me down<br>
Mistaken, always second guessing underestimated, look, I'm still around<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty, pretty, please, don't you ever, ever feel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like you're less than fucking perfect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty, pretty, please, if you ever, ever feel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like you're nothing. You're fucking perfect to me<br>
<br>
You're so mean, when you talk about yourself. You were wrong<br>
Change the voices, change the voices in your head, in your head<br>
Make them like you instead<br>
<br>
So complicated look how we all make it<br>
Filled with so much hatred such a tired game<br>
It's enough, I've done all I can think of<br>
Chased down all my demons I've seen you do the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So cool in lying and we try, try, try but we try too hard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's a waste of my time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we do that, why do I do that, why do I do that?<br>
<br>
Yeah! Oh! Oh, pretty, pretty, pretty<br>

I hate the world today<br>
You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change<br>
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe<br>
I'm an angel underneath, innocent and sweet<br>
<br>
Yesterday I cried<br>
You must have been relieved to see the softer side<br>
I can understand how you'd be so confused<br>
I don't envy you I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm your hell, I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know you wouldn't want it any other way<br>
<br>
So take me as I am<br>
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man<br>
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous<br>
And I'm going to extremes<br>
Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when you think you got me figured out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The season's already changing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's cool, you do what you do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't try to save me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a bitch, I'm a tease I'm a goddess on my knees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hurt, when you suffer I'm your angel undercover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been numb, I'm revived can't say I'm not alive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I wouldn't want it any other way<br>

So many reasons for me to run and hide<br>
I can't do the little things I hold so dear<br>
Cause it's all those little things that I fear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What I've succumbed to is making me numb<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frozen inside without your touch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without your love, darling<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All this time I can't believe I couldn't see<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Got to open my eyes to everything<br>

It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in<br>
Call it what you like, It's time you got to win<br>
Lonely, lonely, lonely, your spirit's sinkin' down<br>
You find you're not the only stranger in this town<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Red lights, green lights, stop 'n go jive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You been stealin' shots from the side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your feelin's go for a ride<br>
<br>
There's danger out tonight..the man is on the prowl<br>
Get the dynamite...the boys are set to prowl<br>
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call<br>
Are you ready for a fight, do you wanna take it all<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowdown, showdown waitin' on line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Showtime, no time for changin' your mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Streets are ringin', march to the sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your secrets follow you down<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody's watchin' you baby, so much you can do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One kiss'll show you now baby, it can happen to you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No more sleepin', wastin' our time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Midnight creepin's first on our minds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No more lazin' round the tv<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll go crazy. come out with me<br>

When the daylight is falling down into the night<br>
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life<br>
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill<br>
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune<br>
Which never stand still<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Big city, big city nights<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You keep me burning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Big city, big city nights<br>

When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes<br>
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side<br>
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before<br>
But it's more like looking out for something<br>
I can't find anymore<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
There is no dream<br>
That you can't make true, if you're looking for love<br>
But there's no girl<br>
Who's burning the ice away from my heart<br>
Maybe tonight!<br>

Big city, big city nights<br>
You keep me burning<br>

I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in<br>

I could work my life away, but why?<br>
I got things to do before I die<br>

Hey, do it now<br>

Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>

Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring<br>

Five of the PM rolls around there's a little old joint outside of town<br>
I only got time for a couple of beers and a jukebox song ringing in my ears<br>
The next you know the bartenders pouring<br>
Shots are flowing got me stoning<br>
All I really know is that I should be going but I'm soaking up the moment<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm all jacked up all jacked up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't believe I've ever had this much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I've learned when you get tore up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time sure flies when you're all jacked up<br>
<br>
It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock<br>
What the hell I have one more shot<br>
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar<br>
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far<br>
Cause a big 'ol girl walked outta the blue<br>
Ten foot, two with a bad attitude<br>
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth<br>
Guess I had it coming I deserved the due<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cause I was all jacked up all jacked up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't believe I've ever had this much<br>

That's what they said when I got my last beer<br>
Oh my God, it's 2:00 I can't find my keys and my truck's locked<br>
So I grabbed a tire tool and I broke my window<br>
Hurt my elbow got me in though<br>
Two foot later backed into the light pole<br>
All the town folk got a good show<br>

<br>
At first I was afraid, I was petrified<br>
I kept thinkin I could never live without you by my side<br>
But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you've done me wrong<br>
I grew strong, I learned how to get along<br>
<br>
And so you're back from outer space<br>
I just walked in to find you here with that look upon your face,<br>
Should have changed my stupid lock, I should've made you leave your key<br>
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh now go, walk out the door<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh not I, I will survive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will survive, I will survive, yeah<br>
<br>
It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart<br>
I'm tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart<br>
And I spent oh so many nights just feelin sorry for myself<br>
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high<br>
<br>
And you'll see me with somebody new<br>
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you<br>
And so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to be free<br>
But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh now go...<br>

I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind<br>
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
And I feel there is nothing I can do, oh yeah<br>
<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you<br>
I really don't mind what happens now and then<br>
As long as you'll be my friend at the end<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'm alive and well will you be there a holding my hand?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kryptonite<br>
<br>
You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep<br>
You took for granted all the times I never let you down<br>
You stumbled in and bumped your head if not for me then you'd be dead<br>
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground<br>

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean<br>
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen<br>
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies<br>
Knockin' me out with those American thighs<br>
<br>
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,<br>
She told me to come, but I was already there<br>
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shook me all night long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you shook me all night long<br>
<br>
Working double time on the seduction line<br>
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine<br>
Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>
<br>
Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,<br>
Now I'm back in the ring to take a-nother swing<br>
Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>

Just about a year ago, I set out on the road.<br>
Seekin my fame and fortune, I'm lookin for a pot of gold.<br>
Things got bad and things got worse, I guess you know the tune<br>
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again.<br>
<br>
Rode in on the Greyhound I'll be walkin' out if I go.<br>
I was just passin through must be seven months or more.<br>
Ran out of time and money looks like they took my friends.<br>
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again.<br>

Solo<br>

The man from the magazine said I was on my way.<br>
Somewhere I lost connections Ran out of songs to play.<br>
I came into town on a one night stand looks like my plans fell through.<br>
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again.<br>

If I only had a dollar for every song I've sung<br>

Well I don't know why I came here tonight I got the feeling that something ain't right<br>
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair and I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am stuck in the middle with you.<br>
<br>
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you and I'm wondering what it is I should do<br>
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clowns to the left..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well you started out with nothing and you're proud that you're a self made man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your friends they all come crawlin slap you on the back and say please, please<br>

Trying to make some sense of it all but I can see that it makes no sense at all<br>

She's got a smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky<br>
Now and then when I see her face she takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet child of mine / love of mine<br>
<br>
She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and rain to quietly pass me by<br>

You've got to trust your instinct, and let go of regret<br>
You've got to bet on yourself now star cause that's your best bet<br>
Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said<br>
<br>
We come with the funky style that gets us known for the show<br>
And we'll mix the hip-hop reggae if we say it is so<br>
And fuck the naysayers cause they don't mean a thing<br>
Cause this is what style we bring<br>
<br>
Now it's morning but last night's on my mind<br>
There's something I need to get off my chest<br>
And no matter what may come to shine<br>
The dream will always be mine<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All mixed up, you don't know what to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Next thing you turn around and find the person is you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought a freak might be the thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the first could be the last, so just get off of your ass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All mixed up, you don't know what to do<br>

Sick sick bit got to have it<br>
Like bustin' in on a session but you got to call it quits<br>
Sick sick bit just can't quit<br>
Fact that you don't even know makes it fully legit<br>
<br>
Now it's morning but last night's on my mind...<br>
<br>
You keep me coming, that is a gal that'll kill dem stunning x 4<br>
<br>
You make me nervous, throat dry, my brain is empty, don't know why<br>
But I saw you doing something which is really truly nothing<br>
But you could bust me out all day<br>
<br>
Many moons since first I saw you, many moons since first we did the do<br>
Many moons since first I saw you, many moons since first we did the do<br>
And why did I try when I knew it was no and<br>
Why did I try when I say it was so<br>
But save it for late we should just let it skate<br>
Cause the waiting feel is fine<br>

Get up, get out, get out of the door<br>
Your playin' cold music on the barroom floor<br>
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.<br>
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town<br>
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.<br>

Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat<br>
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat.<br>
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat<br>
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete.<br>
If Mercy's a bus'ness, I wish it for you<br>
More than just ashes when your dreams come true.<br>

Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door.<br>

The more that you give, the more it will take<br>
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake.<br>

Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain<br>
Let her talk about the things you can't explain<br>
To touch is to heal to hurt is to steal<br>
If you want to kiss the sky better learn how to kneel, on your knees boy!<br>

Please allow me to introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste<br>
I've been around for a long, long year stole many a man's soul and faith<br>
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain<br>
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game<br>
<br>
I stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was a time for a change<br>
Killed the Czar and his ministers Anastasia screamed in vain<br>
I rode a tank held a general's rank<br>
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
I watched with glee while your kings and queens<br>
Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made<br>
I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedys?"<br>
When after all it was you and me<br>
Let me please introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste<br>
And I laid traps for troubadours who get killed before they reached Bombay<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo / Chorus<br>
<br>
Just as every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints<br>
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer cCause I'm in need of some restraint<br>
So if you meet me have some courtesy have some sympathy, and some taste<br>
Use all your well-learned politesse or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah<br>

Woo, who<br>

We ate the food, we drank the wine everybody having a good time<br>
Except you, you were talking about the end of the world<br>
<br>
I took the money, I spiked your drink you miss too much these days if you stop to think<br>
You led me on with those innocent eyes you know I love the element of surprise<br>
In the garden I was playing the tart I kissed your lips and broke your heart<br>
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world<br>

In my dream I was drowning my sorrows but my sorrows they learned to swim<br>
