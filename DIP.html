<button class='accordion css_highlight'>1. All Jacked Up</button>
<div class='panel'>
Five of the PM rolls around there's a little old joint outside of town<br>
I only got time for a couple of beers and a jukebox song ringing in my ears<br>
The next you know the bartenders pouring<br>
Shots are flowing got me stoning<br>
All I really know is that I should be going but I'm soaking up the moment<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm all jacked up all jacked up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't believe I've ever had this much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I've learned when you get tore up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time sure flies when you're all jacked up<br>
<br>
It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock<br>
What the hell I have one more shot<br>
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar<br>
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far<br>
Cause a big 'ol girl walked outta the blue<br>
Ten foot, two with a bad attitude<br>
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth<br>
Guess I had it coming I deserved the due<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cause I was all jacked up all jacked up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't believe I've ever had this much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I've learned when you get tore up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Don't have to go home but you can't stay here<br>
That's what they said when I got my last beer<br>
Oh my God, it's 2:00 I can't find my keys and my truck's locked<br>
So I grabbed a tire tool and I broke my window<br>
Hurt my elbow got me in though<br>
Two foot later backed into the light pole<br>
All the town folk got a good show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All jacked up all jacked up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't believe I've ever had this much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I've learned when you get tore up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't drive your truck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're all jacked up<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacked up (All jacked up, all jacked up)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I've learned when you get tore up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't start no stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're all jacked up<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I've learned when you get tore up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't drive your car<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't start no stuff in no bar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell I wouldn't even tell anybody where you are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're all jacked up<br>
<br>
All jacked up<br>
All jacked up<br>
All jacked up<br>
<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>

<button class='accordion css_highlight'>2. Big City Nights</button>
<div class='panel'>
When the daylight is falling down into the night<br>
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life<br>
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill<br>
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune<br>
Which never stand still<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Big city, big city nights<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You keep me burning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Big city, big city nights<br>
<br>
When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes<br>
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side<br>
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before<br>
But it's more like looking out for something<br>
I can't find anymore<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no dream<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you can't make true, if you're looking for love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's no girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who's burning the ice away from my heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe tonight!<br>
<br>
Big city, big city nights<br>
You keep me burning<br>

I hate the world today<br>
You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change<br>
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe<br>
I'm an angel underneath, innocent and sweet<br>
<br>
Yesterday I cried<br>
You must have been relieved to see the softer side<br>
I can understand how you'd be so confused<br>
I don't envy you I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm your hell, I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know you wouldn't want it any other way<br>
<br>
So take me as I am<br>
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man<br>
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous<br>
And I'm going to extremes<br>
Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when you think you got me figured out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The season's already changing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's cool, you do what you do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't try to save me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a bitch, I'm a tease I'm a goddess on my knees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hurt, when you suffer I'm your angel undercover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been numb, I'm revived can't say I'm not alive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I wouldn't want it any other way<br>

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell<br>
Jimmy Rodgers on the Victrola up high<br>
Mama's dancin with baby on her shoulder<br>
The sun is settin like molasses in the sky<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy could sing, knew how to move everything<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Black velvet and that little boy's smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Black velvet with that slow southern style<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Black velvet if you please<br>
<br>
Up in Memphis the music's like a heat wave<br>
White Lightnin' bound to drive you wild<br>
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl<br>
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every word of every song that he sang was for you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could you do?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>

It's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up<br>
Everything is fucked everybody sucks<br>
You don't really know why but you wanna justify<br>
Rippin' someone's head off<br>
No human contact and if you interact<br>
Your life is on contract<br>
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!<br>
It's just one of those days<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all about the he says/she says bullshit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you better quit lettin shit slip or you'll be leavin with a fat lip<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all about the he says/she says bullshit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you better quit talkin' that shit<br>
<br>
It's just one of those days feelin' like a freight train<br>
First one to complain leaves with a blood stain<br>
Damn right, I'm a maniac you better watch your back cause I'm fuckin' up your program<br>
And if you're stuck up uou're just lucked up<br>
Next in line to get fucked up<br>
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!<br>
It's just one of those days<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Punk, so come and get it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like shit my suggestion is to keep your distance cause right now I'm dangerous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've all felt like shit and been treated like shit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those motherfuckers that want to step up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you know I pack a chain saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll skin your ass raw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if my day keeps goin' this way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just might break somethin' tonight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pack a chainsaw I'll skin your ass raw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if my day keeps goin' this way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just might break somethin' tonight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pack a chainsaw I'll skin your ass raw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if my day keeps goin' this way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just might break your fuckin' face tonight<br>
<br>
Give me somethin' to break<br>
Give me somethin' to break<br>
Just give me somethin' to break<br>
How 'bout your fuckin' face?<br>
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw (what?)<br>
A chainsaw (what?)<br>

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?<br>
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb<br>
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold<br>
Until you find it there and lead it back home<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Wake me up) Wake me up inside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I can't wake up) Before I come undone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become<br>
<br>
Now that I know what I'm without<br>
You can't just leave me<br>
Breathe into me and make me real<br>
Bring me to life<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring me to life (I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring me to life<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frozen inside without your touch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without your love, darling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only you are the life among the dead<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All this time I can't believe I couldn't see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Got to open my eyes to everything<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't let me die here there must be something more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring me to life<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds not healing life's a bitter shame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm goin off the rails on a crazy train<br>
<br>
I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules<br>
One person conditioned to rule and control, the media sells it and you live the role<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds still screaming driving me insane...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that things are going wrong for me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gotta listen to my words, yeah<br>
<br>
Solo<br>
<br>
Heirs of a cold war that's what we've become, inheriting troubles I'm mentally numb<br>
Crazy, I just cannot bear I'm living with something that just isn't fair<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds not healing, who and what's to blame...<br>

You know their business, you think it's a bore, they make you restless it's nothin' you ain't seen before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get around town, spend your time on the run you never let down, say you do it for fun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never miss a play, though you make quite a few you give it all away - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
You crave attention, you can never say "no" throw your affections any way the wind blows<br>
You always make it you're on top of the scene you sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Puttin on the eyes til there's nobody else you never realize what you do to yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that they see make the daily reviews you never get free - everybody wants you<br>

Get up, get out, get out of the door<br>
Your playin' cold music on the barroom floor<br>
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.<br>
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town<br>
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.<br>

I hear the train a comin tt's rolling round the bend<br>
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when<br>
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on<br>
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone<br>
<br>
When I was just a baby my mama told me<br>
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"<br>
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die<br>
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry<br>
<br>
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car<br>
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars<br>
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free<br>
But those people keep a movin'<br>
And that's what tortures me<br>
<br>
Well if they freed me from this prison<br>
If that railroad train was mine<br>
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line<br>
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay<br>
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you<br>

At first I was afraid, I was petrified<br>
I kept thinkin I could never live without you by my side<br>
But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you've done me wrong<br>
I grew strong, I learned how to get along<br>
<br>
And so you're back from outer space<br>
I just walked in to find you here with that look upon your face,<br>
Should have changed my stupid lock, I should've made you leave your key<br>
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh now go, walk out the door<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh not I, I will survive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will survive, I will survive, yeah<br>

It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart<br>
I'm tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart<br>
And I spent oh so many nights just feelin sorry for myself<br>
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high<br>
<br>
And you'll see me with somebody new<br>
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you<br>
And so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to be free<br>
But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me<br>

Just about a year ago, I set out on the road.<br>
Seekin my fame and fortune, I'm lookin for a pot of gold.<br>
Things got bad and things got worse, I guess you know the tune<br>
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again.<br>
<br>
Rode in on the Greyhound I'll be walkin' out if I go.<br>
I was just passin through must be seven months or more.<br>
Ran out of time and money looks like they took my friends.<br>
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again.<br>

Solo<br>
<br>
The man from the magazine said I was on my way.<br>
Somewhere I lost connections Ran out of songs to play.<br>
I came into town on a one night stand looks like my plans fell through.<br>
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again.<br>
<br>
Riff<br>
<br>
If I only had a dollar for every song I've sung<br>
Every time I've had to play while people sat there drunk.<br>

It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in<br>
Call it what you like, It's time you got to win<br>

You find you're not the only stranger in this town<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You been stealin' shots from the side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your feelin's go for a ride<br>

There's danger out tonight..the man is on the prowl<br>
Get the dynamite...the boys are set to prowl<br>
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call<br>
Are you ready for a fight, do you wanna take it all<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowdown, showdown waitin' on line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Showtime, no time for changin' your mind<br>

Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you fall apart, but this ain't my mama's broken heart<br>
<br>
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic<br>
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames<br>
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches<br>
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame<br>
<br>
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation<br>
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make<br>
My mama came from a softer generation<br>
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face<br>

When I was younger that all bodies aren't the same<br>

If I could go back and tell myself when I was younger, I'd say, psst<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Victoria's secret and girl you wouldn't believe<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;She was made up by a dude (dude)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria was made up by a dude (dude)<br>

Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights<br>
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours<br>
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers<br>
And I'm a-hopin for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey momma rock me<br>

Running from the cold up in New England<br>
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band<br>
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now<br>
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down<br>
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street. Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet.<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high. I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.<br>
<br>
Life is too short so love the one you got. Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same. Livin with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah. Me and my baby in '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of '69, yeah.<br>

She's got a smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky<br>
Now and then when I see her face she takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet child of mine / love of mine<br>
<br>
She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and rain to quietly pass me by<br>
