<button class='accordion'>1. Folsom Prison Blues</button>
<div class='panel'>
I hear the train a comin it's rolling round the bend<br>
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when<br>
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin on<br>
But that train keeps a rollin on down to San Antone<br>
<br>
When I was just a baby my mama told me "Son<br>
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"<br>
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die<br>
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car<br>
They're probably drinkin coffee and smoking big cigars<br>
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free<br>
But those people keep a movin and that's what tortures me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine<br>
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line<br>
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay<br>
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away<br>

Midnight, gettin uptight, where are you?<br>
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two<br>
I know I'm hangin but I'm still wantin' you<br>
<br>
Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town<br>
I turn my back and you're messin' around<br>
I'm not getting jealous, don't like lookin like a clown<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of you every night and day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You took my heart, and you took my pride away<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate myself for loving you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't break free from the the things that you do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna walk but I run back to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I hate myself for loving you<br>
<br>
[Riff x 2]<br>
<br>
Daylight, spent the night without you<br>
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do<br>
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through<br>
<br>
Hey man, bet you can't treat me right<br>
You just don't know what you was missin last night<br>
I wanna see you beggin', say, "Forget it" just for spite<br>

Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone<br>
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own<br>
<b>Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call<br>
You feel the time is right (say) the writin's on the wall<br>

It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in<br>
Call it what you like, It's time you got to win<br>
<b>Lonely, lonely, lonely, your spirit's sinkin' down<br>
You find you're not the only stranger in this town<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Red lights, green lights, stop 'n go jive<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You been stealin' shots from the side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your feelin's go for a ride (1 measure pause)<br>
<br>
There's danger out tonight..the man is on the prowl<br>

You're goin' all about it in the worst ways<br>

Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>

You see em comin at you every night strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight<br>
You know their business, you think it's a bore, they make you restless it's nothin' you ain't seen before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get around town, spend your time on the run you never let down, say you do it for fun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never miss a play, though you make quite a few you give it all away - everybody wants you<br>
<br>
You crave attention, you can never say "no" throw your affections any way the wind blows<br>
You always make it you're on top of the scene you sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Puttin on the eyes til there's nobody else you never realize what you do to yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that they see make the daily reviews you never get free - everybody wants you<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows you, everybody snows you<br>

Nights of confusion and impossible dreams days at the mirror patchin up around the seams<br>
You got your glory you paid for it all you take your pension in loneliness and alcohol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say goodbye to conventional ways you can't escape the hours you lose track of the days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you understand seems the more like you do you never get away... everybody wants you<br>

Hey, do it now<br>

Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>

But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>

Don't know what I did next, all I know, I couldn't stop<br>
<br>
Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists<br>
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook<br>
I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it<br>
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and fix your makeup girl, it's just a breakup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you fall apart, but this ain't my mama's broken heart<br>
<br>
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic<br>
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames<br>
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches<br>
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame<br>
<br>
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation<br>
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make<br>

and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all<br>
Go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall<br>
<br>
And if you go chasing rabbits and you know you're going to fall<br>
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call<br>
Call Alice when she was just small<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and you've just had some kind of mushroom and your mind is moving low<br>
<br>
Go ask Alice, I think she'll know<br>
When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead<br>
and the white knight is talking backwards and the red queen's off with her head<br>
Remember what the door mouse said "Feed your head! Feed your head!"<br>

<br>
I hate the world today, you're so good to me, I know, but I can't change<br>
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe<br>
I'm an angel underneath, innocent and sweet [2/4]<br>
<br>
Yesterday I cried, you must have been relieved to see the softer side<br>
I can understand how you'd be so confused<br>
I don't envy you I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm your hell, I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know you wouldn't want it any other way<br>
<br>
So take me as I am, this may mean you'll have to be a stronger man<br>
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous<br>
And I'm going to extremes<br>
Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when you think you got me figured out the season's already changing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a bitch, I'm a tease I'm a goddess on my knees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hurt, when you suffer I'm your angel undercover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been numb, I'm revived can't say I'm not alive<br>

Heading down south to the land of the pines<br>
I'm thumbing my way into North Carolina<br>
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights<br>
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours<br>
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers<br>
And I'm a-hopin for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So rock me momma like a wagon wheel rock me momma any way you feel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey momma rock me<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey momma rock me<br>
<br>
Running from the cold up in New England<br>
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band<br>
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now<br>
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down<br>
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town<br>
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more<br>

I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke<br>

I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one<br>

Liquor was the only love I'd known<br>
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br>

I've looked for love in all the same old places<br>

Change the voices in your head, make them like you instead<br>

Five of the PM rolls around there's a little old joint outside of town<br>
I only got time for a couple of beers and a jukebox song ringing in my ears<br>
The next you know the bartender's pouring shots are flowing got me stoning<br>
All I really know is that I should be going but I'm soaking up the moment<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm all jacked up, all jacked up<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Time sure flies when you're all jacked up<br>
<br>
It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock what the hell I have one more shot<br>
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar guess I mighta musta gone a little too far<br>
Cause a big ol girl walked outta the blue ten foot, two with a bad attitude<br>
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth guess I had it coming I deserved the due<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause I was all jacked up all jacked up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't believe I've ever had this much<br>

Don't have to go home but you can't stay here that's what they said when I got my last beer<br>

So I grabbed a tire tool and I broke my window hurt my elbow got me in though<br>
Two foot later backed into the light pole all the town folk got a good show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All jacked up, all jacked up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't believe I've ever had this much<br>

Getting weapons with the greatest of ease<br>
The gangs stake out their own campus locale<br>
And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal<br>
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix<br>
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, man, you talkin' back to me? Take him out (you gotta keep 'em separated)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, man, you disrespecting me? Take him out (you gotta keep 'em separated)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, they don't pay no mind if you're under 18 you won't be doing any time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, come out and play<br>
<br>
By the time you hear the siren, it's already too late<br>
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail<br>
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste<br>
It goes down the same as the thousand before<br>
No one's getting smarter, no one's learning the score<br>
Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate<br>
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
It goes down the same as the thousand before<br>
No one's getting smarter, no one's learning the score<br>
Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate<br>

Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?<br>
Get up, get out, get out of the door<br>
Your playin' cold music on the barroom floor<br>
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.<br>
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town<br>
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire! Fire on the mountain!<br>

Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat<br>
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat.<br>
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat<br>
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete.<br>
If Mercy's a bus'ness, I wish it for you<br>
More than just ashes when your dreams come true.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire! Fire on the mountain!<br>

Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?<br>
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door.<br>
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor<br>
You gave all you had. Why you wanna give more?<br>
The more that you give, the more it will take<br>
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake.<br>

In our defense, silence.<br>

That's when they'll disappear, that's when you'll be feared.<br>

Johnny was a schoolboy, when he heard his first Beatles song.<br>
Love Me Do, I think it was, and from there it didn't take him long.<br>
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night<br>
Now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit, and everything's alright.<br>
Don't you know?<br>
<br>
Johnny told his Mama, "Hey, Mama, I'm goin' away.<br>
I'm gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday".<br>
Mama came to the door, with a teardrop in her eye.<br>
Johnny said, "don't cry, Mama, smile and wave goodbye".<br>
Don't you know? Yeah..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you know that you are a shooting star?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you know? Don't you know?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you know that you are a shooting star?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world will love you just as long, as long as you are.<br>
<br>
Johnny made a record, went straight up to number one.<br>
Suddenly everyone loved, to hear him sing his song<br>
Watchin' the world go by, surprisin' it goes so fast<br>
Johnny looked around him and said, "well, I made the big-time at last".<br>
Don't you know?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo / Chorus<br>

Johnny died one night, died in his bed.<br>
Bottle of whisky, sleeping tablets by his head.<br>
Johnny's life passed him by, like a warm summer day.<br>
If you listen to the wind, you can still hear him play.<br>

I thought I saw a man brought to life<br>
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified, he showed me what it was to cry<br>
Well you couldn't be that man I adored<br>
You don't seem to know seem to care what your heart is for<br>
But I don't know him anymore<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what's going on. Nothing's fine I'm torn<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street. Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet.<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high. I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.<br>
<br>
Life is too short so love the one you got. Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same. Livin with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>
