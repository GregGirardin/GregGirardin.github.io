For no one can fill those of your needs that you won't let show<br>

Twenty thousand miles to an oasis. Twenty thousand years will I burn<br>
Twenty thousand chances I wasted. Waiting for the moment to turn<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would give my life to find it I would give it all. Catch me if I fall<br>
<br>
Walking through the woods I have faced. It looking for something to learn<br>
Thirty thousand thoughts have replaced it. Never in my time to return<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone, waiting to fall<br>
<br>
Forty thousand stars in the evening. Look at them fall from the sky<br>
Forty thousand reasons for living. Forty thousand tears in your eye<br>

Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise<br>
Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice<br>
With a step to your left and a flick to the right you catch that mirror way out west<br>
You know you're something special and you look like you're the best<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like that river twisting though the dusty land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she shines she really shows you all she can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande<br>
<br>
I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV<br>
Two of a billion stars, it means so much to me<br>
Like a birthday or a pretty view<br>
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you<br>

Tonight, I throw myself into<br>

Slow how, you wanted it to be<br>
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If everything could ever feel this real forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything could ever be this good again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I'll ever ask of you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You gotta promise not to stop when I say when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She sang<br>

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in, hold you in<br>

So, dad would take the Sundays off<br>
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest<br>
And so, because we were loud on Sundays<br>
He'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep<br>
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, "Dad, come on, please"<br>
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy<br>

Especially at night I worry over situations<br>
I know will be alright perhaps it's just imagination<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day it reappears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts appear and fade away.....<br>
<br>
Alone between the sheets only brings exasperation<br>
It's time to walk the streets smell the desperation<br>
At least there's pretty lights and though there's little variation<br>
It nullifies the night from overkill...<br>

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day<br>
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way<br>
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown<br>
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way<br>
<br>
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain<br>
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today<br>
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you<br>
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun<br>

And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking<br>
Racing around to come up behind you again<br>
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older<br>
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death<br>
<br>
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time<br>
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines<br>
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way<br>
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say<br>
<br>
Home, home again<br>
I like to be here when I can<br>
When I come home, cold and tired<br>
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire<br>
Far away, across the field<br>
The tolling of the iron bell<br>
Calls the faithful to their knees<br>
To hear the softly spoken magic spells<br>
<br>
