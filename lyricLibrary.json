Cause you might get run over or you might get shot.\nNever start no static I just get it off my chest. Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.\nTake a small example, take a tip from me. Take all of your money give it all to charity.\nLove is what I got, it's within my reach, and the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach.\nIt all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve try and test that you're bound to get served\nLove's what I got don't start a riot you'll feel it when the dance gets hot\n\n  Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that\n\nWhy I don't cry when my dog runs away. I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.\nI don't get angry when my mom smokes pot. Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock.\nFuckin' and fightin it's all the same.

Little darlin', don't shed no tears\n\nSaid, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown.\nAnd then Georgie would make the fire light log wood burnin through the night\nThen we would cook cornmeal porridge of which I'll share with you\nMy feet is my only carriage so I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone\n\n  Everything's gonna be all right\n\nChorus / V1",
