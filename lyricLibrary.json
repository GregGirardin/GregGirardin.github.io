she's buying a stairway to heaven\n\nThere's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure\nCause you know, sometimes words have two meanings\nIn a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings\nSometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven\n\n  Ooh, it makes me wonder x 2\n\nThere's a feeling I get when I look to the west\nAnd my spirit is crying for leaving\nIn my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees\nAnd the voices of those who stand looking\n\n  Ooh, it makes me wonder x 2\n\nAnd it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune\nThen the piper will lead us to reason\nAnd a new day will dawn for those who stand long\nAnd the forests will echo with laughter\n\n  Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, oh-oh\n\n    If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now\n    It's just a spring clean for the May Queen\n    Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run\n    And there's still time to change the road you're on\n\n  And it makes me wonder\n\n    Your head is humming and it won't go in case you don't know\n    The piper's calling you to join him\n    Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? and did you know\n    Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?\n\nAnd as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know, who shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one and one is all, yeah\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to heaven",
