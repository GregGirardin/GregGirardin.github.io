Fire on the mountain!\n\nLong distance runner, what you holdin' out for?\nCaught in slow motion in a dash for the door.\nThe flame from your stage has now spread to the floor\nYou gave all you had.

My baby cried. His eyes were like mine.\nCan we dance on the floor in the round?\n\n  People always told me, be careful what you do.\n  And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts\n  But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.\n  This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey\n\nChorus",
