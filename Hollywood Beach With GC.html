I don't care if Monday's blue, Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as sleek as a shriek spinning 'round and 'round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always take a big bite it's such a gorgeous sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see you eat in the middle of the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can never get enough, enough of this stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Friday, I'm in love<br>

Lay where you're laying, don't make a sound<br>
I know they're watching, they're watching<br>
All the commotion, the kiddie-like play<br>
It has people talking, talking<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>
<br>
The dark of the alley, the breaking of day<br>
Head while I'm driving, I'm driving<br>
Soft lips are open, them knuckles are pale<br>
Feels like you're dying, you're dying<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumed, with what's just transpired<br>
<br>
Hot as a fever, rattle of bones<br>
I could just taste it, taste it<br>
If this not forever, if this just tonight<br>
Oh we're still the greatest, the greatest, the greatest<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, your sex is on fire<br>

If he stops to think he starts to cry, oh, why?<br>

Well, she was an American girl raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>
And if she had to die tryin she had one little promise she was gonna keep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you lie when you spoke to me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you stand by me? No, not at all<br>
<br>
Now I got a job but it don't pay<br>
I need new clothes I need somewhere to stay<br>
But without all of these things I can do<br>
But without your love I won't make it through<br>
But you don't understand my point of view<br>
I suppose there's nothing I can do<br>

Darling, you've got to let me know, should I stay or should I go,<br>
If you say that you are mine, I'll be here 'til the end of time,<br>
So you've got to let me know, should I stay or should I go?<br>
<br>
It's always tease, tease, tease, you're happy when I'm on my knees,<br>
One day it's fine, and next it's black, so if you want me off your back,<br>
Well, come on, and let me know... Should I stay or should I go?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I stay, or should I go now? (¿Yo me enfrio o lo soplo?)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I stay, or should I go now? (¿Yo me enfrio o lo soplo?)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I go there will be trouble, (Si me voy va a haber peligro!)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I stay it will be double, (Si me quedo sera el doble!)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So you gotta let me know... (Me tienes que decir...)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I cool it, or should I blow? (¿Yo me enfrio o lo soplo?)<br>
<br>
This indecision's buggin' me, (Esta indecisión me molesta)<br>
If you don't want me, set me free! (Si no me quieres, líbrame!)<br>
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be? (Digame quein tengo ser!)<br>
Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (¿No sabes que ropas me queda?)<br>
Come on, and let me know... (Me tienes que decir..)<br>
Should I cool it, or should I blow? (¿Me debo ir o quedarme?)<br>

Blues in A<br>

I got a little change in my pocket goin' jing-a-ling-a-ling<br>
Wants to call you on the telephone baby, a-give you a ring<br>
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing<br>
Always no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' ring<br>
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf<br>
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself<br>
<br>
B-baby baby baby why you wan' treat me this way<br>
You know I'm still your lover boy I still feel the same way<br>
That's when she told me a story, 'bout free milk and a cow<br>
And said no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' vow<br>
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf<br>
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself<br>
<br>
Hold it here<br>
See I wanted her real bad, and I was about to give in<br>
But that's when she started talking about true love, started talking about sin<br>
And I said, honey I'll live with you for the rest of my life,<br>
She said no hug-ee no kiss-ee until you make me your wife-a<br>
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf<br>
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself<br>

<button class='accordion css_medleyEnd'>16. Johnny B. Goode</button>
<div class='panel'>
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans<br>
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood<br>
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
Who never ever learned to read or write so well<br>
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, go.. go Johnny, go, go Johnny B. Goode<br>
<br>
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track<br>
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade<br>
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made<br>
The people passing by they would stop and say<br>
"Oh my what that little country boy could play"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
His mother told him "someday you will be a man<br>
And you will be the leader of a big old band<br>
Many people coming from miles around<br>
To hear you play your music when the sun go down<br>
Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"<br>

She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies<br>
Knockin' me out with those American thighs<br>
<br>
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,<br>

Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>

to see a little bit clearer, the rottenness and evil in me<br>
Fingertips have memories, mine can't forget the curves of your body<br>

Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding<br>
The cretins cloning and feeding, and I don't even own a TV<br>
Put me in the hospital for nerves and then they had to commit me<br>
You told them all I was crazy, they cut off my legs now I'm an amputee,<br>

<br>
Very superstitious, wash your face and hands<br>
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can<br>
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong<br>
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
Very superstitious, nothin' more to say<br>
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way<br>
Thirteen months old baby, broke the lookin' glass<br>
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past<br>

<div class='panel'>
Hey, do it now<br>
<br>
Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Intro (instrumental)<br>
<br>
On a cobweb afternoon, in a room full of emptiness<br>
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages<br>
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone<br>
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we wanna go<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In your house, I long to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Room by room, patiently<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll wait for you there like a stone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll wait for you there alone<br>
<br>
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels<br>
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven<br>
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago<br>
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
And on I read until the day was gone<br>
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done<br>
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged<br>
In dreams until my death, I will wander on<br>

Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah. Me and my baby in '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of '69, yeah.<br>

And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack<br>
And you may find yourself in another part of the world<br>
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile<br>
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife<br>
And you may ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Letting the days go by, water flowing underground<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the blue again after the money's gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground<br>
<br>
And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?"<br>
And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?"<br>
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house"<br>
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife"<br>

Water dissolving and water removing<br>
There is water at the bottom of the ocean<br>
Under the water, carry the water<br>
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean<br>
Water dissolving and water removing<br>

You may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?"<br>
You may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?"<br>

Same as it ever was x 6<br>
Letting the days go by, same as it ever was<br>
Here a twister comes, here comes the twister<br>
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (Letting the days go by) x 2<br>

I've been on tenterhooks, ending in dirty looks<br>
List'ning to the Muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that<br>
She said, "That's that, I don't wanna chitter chat"<br>
Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump it up when you don't really need it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump it up until you can feel it<br>

Down in the pleasure center, hell bent or heaven sent<br>
listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander<br>
There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump it up until you can feel it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump it up when you don't really need it<br>
<br>
She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical<br>
Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic<br>
You wanna torture her, you wanna talk to her<br>
All the things you bought for her, puttin' up your temp'rature<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump it up until you can feel it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump it up when you don't really need it<br>
<br>
Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin<br>
You put your passion out under the pressure pin<br>
Fall into submission, hit and run transmission<br>
No use wishin' now for any other sin<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump it up until you can feel it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump it up when you don't really need it&nbsp;&nbsp;x 3<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Intro<br>
<br>
When I read your letter, I couldn't believe that you're gone<br>
I dialed your number, but no one answered the phone<br>
<br>
I asked your friends to tell me if they knew where you were<br>
They said they thought that you were ill<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Break (instrumental)<br>
<br>
I hired a detective to try and find out where you are<br>
He managed to trace you, he said you were living in France<br>
<br>
A watchman saw you climb into someone else's car<br>
And drive off laughing in the night<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn't you tell me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not leave me this way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooh, you could've told me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waited for so long<br>
<br>
I tried to forget you, but I found myself walking the street<br>
I went to the doctor and he gave me something to sleep<br>
<br>
I sent you telegrams, but you haven't answered one<br>
Your mother told me, I best leave you well alone<br>
I hope you're satisfied, now you've done this thing to me<br>
I hope you're pleased with what you've done<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn't you tell me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not leave me this way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooh, you could've told me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waited for so long<br>
<br>
(For so long) I never realized just exactly who you are<br>
(For so long) I never realized the girl I had before<br>
(For so long) I hope you're satisfied, you won't hear from me again<br>
(For so long) I hope you're pleased with what you've done<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn't you tell me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not leave me this way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooh, you could've told me<br>

By the time you hear the siren, it's already too late<br>
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail<br>

It goes down the same as the thousand before<br>

Two lovers in the bedroom and the other starts to shout<br>
All I got is this blank stare and that don't carry no clout at all<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Destination unknown ruby ruby ruby ruby soho x 2<br>
<br>
He's singin' and she's there to lend a hand<br>
He's seen his name on the marquee but she will never understand<br>
Once again he's leavin and she's there with a tear in her eye<br>
Embraces with a warm gesture it's time, time to say goodbye<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Ruby's heart ain't beatin cause she knows the feelin' is gone<br>
She's not the only one who knew there's somethin wrong<br>
Her lover's in the distance as she wipes a tear from her eye<br>
Ruby's fading out she disappears it's time, time to say goodbye<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho x 4<br>

I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four<br>
Throw all on your clothes the second side of Surfer Rosa<br>

It starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy<br>
Something inching past the edge of the reserve<br>

Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty the sound of their voice fades with the light<br>
I think about the loveless fascination under the Milky Way tonight<br>

Lower the curtains down on Memphis lower the curtains down alright<br>
I've got no time for private consultation under the Milky Way tonight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish I knew what you were looking for<br>

Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?<br>
My homeroom homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat<br>
She was pure like snowflakes, no one could ever stain<br>
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Years go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My angel is the centerfold, angel is the centerfold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold<br>
<br>
Slipped me notes under the desk while I was thinkin' about her dress<br>
I was shy, I turned away before she caught my eye<br>
I was shakin' in my shoes whenever she flashed those baby-blues<br>
Something had a hold on me when angel passed close by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those soft and fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see her in that negligee is really just too much<br>

It's okay I understand, this ain't no never-never land<br>
I hope that when this issue's gone I'll see you when your clothes are on<br>
Take your car, yes we will, we'll take your car and drive it<br>
We'll take it to a motel room and take 'em off in private<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A part of me has just been ripped, the pages from my mind are stripped<br>

I was cuttin' the rug down at a place called 'The Jug' with a girl named Linda Lou<br>
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand, he was looking for you know who.<br>
He said "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow, watcha tryin to prove?<br>
Cuz thats my woman there and I'm a man who cares and this might be all for you"<br>
(I said "excuse me!")<br>
<br>
I was scared and fearing for my life,I was shaking like a leaf on a tree<br>
Cuz he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord, a pointing that gun at me<br>
"Oh wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her, don't want no trouble with you<br>
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me ask one favor from you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, won't you gimme three steps .. mister .. toward the door?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gimme three steps .. mister and you'll never see me no more. For sure<br>
<br>
Oh, well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray and the water fell on the floor.<br>
And I'm telling you, son, well it ain't no fun, staring straight down a forty-four.<br>
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou, and that's the break I was looking for<br>
and you could hear me screaming a mile away as I was headed out toward the door.<br>

<div class='panel'>
The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Break * (vocal comes in near the end of the break)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing, one thing leads to another..<br>
<br>
Then it's easy to believe, somebody's been lying to me<br>
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>
