Woo-hoo,woo-hoo<br>
<br>
Well my heart knows me better than I know myself so I'm gonna let it do all the talking.<br>
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere with a big black horse and a cherry tree.<br>
I felt a little fear upon my back I said "Don't look back, just keep on walking.<br>
When the big black horse said, "Look this way" He said, "Hey there baby, will you marry me?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspBut I said no... I said, no, no, you're not the one for me<br>
<br>
And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours, so I stopped it dead for a beat or two.<br>
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it, and it won't forgive me after all these years<br>
So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere with a big black horse and a cherry tree.<br>
Now it won't come back, cause it's oh so happy and now I've got a hole for the world to see<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>

&nbsp&nbspBig black horse and a cherry tree<br>
&nbsp&nbspI can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me<br>

I feel so unsure as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor<br>
As the music dies, something in your eyes<br>
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspI'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>
&nbsp&nbspThough it's easy to pretend I know your not a fool<br>
&nbsp&nbspShould've known better than to cheat a friend and waste the chance that I've been given<br>
&nbsp&nbspSo I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you<br>
<br>
Time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend<br>
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind<br>
There's no comfort in the truth pain is all you'll find<br>
<br>
Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd<br>
Maybe it's better this way we'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say<br>
We could have been so good together we could have lived this dance forever<br>
But no one's gonna dance with me, please stay<br>
<br>
Now that you're gone<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd what it all comes down to is that everything's gonna be fine<br>
&nbsp&nbspCause I got one hand in my pocket and the other one is givin' a high five<br>
<br>
I feel drunk but I'm sober I'm young and I'm underpaid. I'm dying but I'm workin yeah<br>
I care but I'm restless I'm here but I'm really gone. I'm wrong and I'm sorry baby<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp. is that everything's gonna be quite alright<br>
&nbsp&nbsp. and the other one is flickin a cigarette<br>

<br>
On the first part of the journey I was lookin at all the life<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz and the sky with no clouds<br>
The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspI've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
&nbsp&nbspit felt good to be out of the rain<br>
&nbsp&nbspin the desert you can remember your name<br>
&nbsp&nbsp'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la<br>
<br>
After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground and the perfect disguise above<br>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun<br>
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy and God, I know, I'm one<br>
<br>
My mother was a tailor she sewed my new blue jeans<br>
My father was a gambling man down in New Orleans.<br>
<br>
Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk<br>
And the only time, he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk<br>
<br>
O mother, tell your children not to do what I have done<br>
Spend your lives in sin and misery in the house of Rising Sun<br>
<br>
Well I got one foot on the platform the other foot on the train<br>
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain<br>

Now here you go again you say you want your freedom well who am I to keep you down?<br>
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it<br>
But listen carefully to the sound<br>
Of your loneliness, like a heartbeat drives you mad<br>
In the stillness of remembering what you had<br>
And what you lost, and what you had, and what you lost<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
&nbsp&nbspPlayers only love you when they're playing<br>
&nbsp&nbspWomen they will come and they will go<br>
&nbsp&nbspWhen the rain washes you clean you'll know, you'll know<br>
<br>
Solo<br>
<br>
Now here I go again I see your crystal visions, I keep my visions to myself<br>
It's only me who wants to wrap around you dreams and<br>
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell<br>
Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad<br>
In the stillness of remembering what you had<br>
And what you lost, and what you had, ooh what you lost<br>

So, so you think you can tell, heaven from hell, blue skies from pain<br>
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil<br>
Do you think you can tell?<br>
<br>
Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change<br>
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage<br>
<br>
How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year<br>
Running over the same old ground what have we found<br>
the same old fears. Wish you were here<br>

<br>
For six long years I've been in trouble no pleasure here on Earth I found<br>
For in this world I'm bound to ramble I have no friends to help me now<br>
&nbsp&nbspHe has no friends to help him now<br>
<br>
It's fare-thee-well my old true lover I never expect to see you again<br>
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad perhaps I'll die upon this train<br>
&nbsp&nbspPerhaps he'll die upon this train<br>
<br>
Harmonica IV<br>
<br>
You can bury me in some deep valley for many years where I may lay<br>
And you may learn to love another while I am sleeping in my grave<br>
&nbsp&nbspWhile he is sleeping in his grave<br>
<br>
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger my face you never will see no more<br>
But there is one promise that is given I'll meet you on God's golden shore<br>
&nbsp&nbspHe'll meet you on God's golden shore<br>

Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies<br>
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly a girl with kaleidoscope eyes<br>
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green towering over your head<br>
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspLucy in the sky with diamonds<br>
<br>
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies<br>
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers that grow so incredibly high<br>
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore waiting to take you away<br>
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone<br>

Can the child within my heart rise above<br>
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides<br>
Can I handle the seasons of my life.. mmm...<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp&nbspeven your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspDoes that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice.<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are?<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control?<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWell, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>
<br>
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>
And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them<br>
