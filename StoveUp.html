<button class='accordion'>2. Found Out About You</button>
<div class='panel'>
All last summer in case you don't recall<br>
I was yours and you were mine forget it all<br>
Is there a line that I could write<br>
That's sad enough to make you cry?<br>
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies<br>
<br>
Months roll past the love that you struck dead<br>
Did you love me only in my head?<br>
The things you said and did to me they seem to come so easily<br>
The love I thought I'd won you give for free<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispers at the bus stop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I found out about you, I found out about you<br>
<br>
Rumors follow everywhere you go<br>
Like when you left and I was last to know<br>
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt in all the places you hang out<br>
They know your name and they know what you're about<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Street lights blink on through the car window<br>
I get the time too often on AM Radio<br>
Well you know it's all I think about I write your name, drive past your house<br>
Your boyfriend's over I watch your lights go out<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

<button class='accordion'>3. Backwater</button>
<div class='panel'>
And when I wake up in the morning<br>
To feel the daybreak on my face<br>
There's a blood that's flowin through the feeling<br>
With a knife to open up the sky's veins<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things will never change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They may seem rearranged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the backwater swirling there is something that will never change<br>
<br>
And when I shoulda been gone a long time<br>
Laughs and says, I find ways<br>
Just when we're sheltered under paper<br>
The rockets come at us sideways<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey I'm blind, good fine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll the time, on whose dime<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
And when I wake up in the morning<br>
To feel the daybreak on my face<br>
There's a blood that's flowin' through the ceiling<br>
With a knife to open up the sky's veins<br>

She calls me from the cold just when I was low, feeling short of stable<br>
All that she intends and all she keeps inside isn't on the label<br>
She says she's ashamed and can she take me for awhile?<br>
And can I be a friend we'll forget the past but maybe I'm not able<br>
And I break at the bend<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We're here and now will we ever be again cause I have found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again<br>
<br>
She dreams a champagne dream strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper<br>
Lavender and cream Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her<br>
She says that love is for fools who fall behind<br>
And I'm somewhere between I never really know a killer from a savior<br>
'Til I break at the bend<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We're here and now...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's too far away for me to hold too far away<br>
<br>
Solo<br>

<div class='panel'>
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind<br>
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time<br>
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy<br>
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you help me occupy my brain?<br>
<br>
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find<br>
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind<br>
<br>
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry<br>
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal<br>
<br>
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state<br>
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>

Must've been mid afternoon<br>
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and<br>
He walked with a purpose<br>
In his sneakers, down the street<br>
He had many questions like children often do, he said:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me am I very far<br>
<br>
Must've been late afternoon<br>
on our way the sun broke free of the clouds<br>
We count only blue cars<br>
Skip the cracks in the street<br>
And ask many questions like children often do, we said:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God cause I'd really like to meet her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask her why we're who we are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me all your thoughts on God cause I'm on my way to see her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me am I very far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I very far now?<br>

It's getting cold, picked up the pace.<br>
How our shoes make hard noises in this place.<br>
Our clothes are stained<br>
We pass many cross-eyed people<br>
And ask many questions like children often do<br>

To leave you there by yourself chained to fate<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't scream about, don't think aloud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn your head now, baby, just spit me out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn your head now, baby, just spit me out<br>
<br>
Why follow me to higher ground?<br>
Lost as you swear I am<br>
Don't throw away your basic needs<br>
Ambiance and vanity<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus x2<br>
<br>
December promise you gave unto me<br>
December whispers of treachery<br>
December clouds are now covering me<br>
December songs no longer I sing<br>
<br>
December promise you gave unto me<br>
December whispers of treachery<br>
December clouds are now covering me<br>
December songs no longer I sing<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus x2<br>
