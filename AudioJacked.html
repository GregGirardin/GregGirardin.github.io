Hook me up a new revolution cause this one is a lie<br>
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I'm looking to the sky to save me looking for a sign of life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for something to help me burn out bright<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm looking for a complication looking cause I'm tired of lying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make my way back home when I learn to fly high<br>
<br>
I think I'm done nursing the patience it can wait one night<br>
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try<br>
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life<br>
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright<br>

Take the last train to Clarksville and I'll meet you at the station<br>

I was cuttin' the rug down at a place called 'The Jug' with a girl named Linda Lou<br>
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand, he was looking for you know who.<br>
He said "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow, watcha tryin to prove?<br>
Cuz thats my woman there and I'm a man who cares and this might be all for you"<br>
(I said "excuse me!")<br>
<br>
I was scared and fearing for my life,I was shaking like a leaf on a tree<br>
Cuz he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord,&nbsp;&nbsp;a pointing that gun at me<br>
"Oh wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her, don't want no trouble with you<br>
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me ask one favor from you<br>
<br>
 Oh, won't you gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister, gimme three steps toward the door?<br>
 Gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister<br>
 and you'll never see me no more. For sure"<br>
<br>
Oh, well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray and the water fell on the floor.<br>
And I'm telling you, son, well it ain't no fun, staring straight down a forty-four.<br>

and you could hear me screaming a mile away as I was headed out toward the door.<br>

Always no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' ring<br>

<div class='panel'>
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans<br>
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood<br>
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
Who never ever learned to read or write so well<br>
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, go.. Go Johnny, go, go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny B. Goode<br>
<br>
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track<br>
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade<br>
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made<br>
The people passing by they would stop and say<br>
"Oh my what that little country boy could play"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
His mother told him "someday you will be a man<br>
And you will be the leader of a big old band<br>
Many people coming from miles around<br>
To hear you play your music when the sun go down<br>
Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"<br>

I see the bad moon a-rising, I see trouble on the way<br>
I see earthquakes and lightning, I see bad times today<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't go around tonight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it's bound to take your life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a bad moon on the rise<br>
<br>
I hear hurricanes a-blowing, I know the end is coming soon<br>
I fear rivers overflowing, I hear the voice of rage and ruin<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

Hope you got your things together, hope you are quite prepared to die<br>
Looks like we're in for nasty weather, one eye is taken for an eye<br>

see them long trains running, and watch them disappear<br>

<button class='accordion'>5. One Thing Leads To Another</button>
<div class='panel'>
The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Break *<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another..<br>
<br>
Then it's easy to believe, somebody's been lying to me<br>
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>
<br>

I really don't mind what happens now and then<br>
As long as you'll be my friend at the end<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?<br>

You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep<br>
