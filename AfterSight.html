One life I'm gonna live it up<br>
I'm takin' flight I said I'll never get enough<br>
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud<br>
I'm on top as long as the music's loud<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You're thinkin like a fool, cause it's a case of do or die<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out there is a fortune waiting to be had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You think I'll let it go, you're mad, you've got another thing comin<br>
<br>
That's right here's where the talkin' ends<br>
Well listen this night, there'll be some action spent<br>
Drive hard I'm callin all the shots<br>
I got an ace card comin down on the rocks<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, I ain't foolin and you better think again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out there is a fortune waiting to be had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You think I'll let it go, you're mad, you've got another thing comin<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world we're livin in, we have our share of sorrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer now and don't give in aim&nbsp;&nbsp;for a new tomorrow<br>
<br>

Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah<br>

<button class='accordion'>5. Twilight Zone</button>
<div class='panel'>
Somewhere in a lonely hotel room<br>
There's a guy starting to realize<br>
That eternal fate has turned its back on him It's two A.M<br>
<br>
It's two A.M., the fear has gone<br>
I'm sitting here waitin', the gun's still warm<br>
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances<br>
Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head<br>
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead<br>
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My beacon's been moved under moon and star<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where am I to go now that I've gone too far? x 2<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon you will come to know when the bullet hits the bone<br>
<br>
I'm falling down the spiral destination unknown<br>
Double crossed messenger all alone<br>
Can't get no connection, can't get through where are you?<br>
Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind<br>
This far from the borderline<br>
When the hitman comes he knows damn well he has been cheated<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?<br>
I didn't mean to call you that<br>
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me please tell me<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please tell me why my car is in the front yard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm sleeping with my clothes on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I came in through the window last night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you're gone, gone<br>
<br>
It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy<br>
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me<br>
The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette still burning<br>
<br>
Chorus / Solo / Chorus<br>

I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind<br>
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
And I feel there is nothing I can do, oh yeah<br>
<br>
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon<br>
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you<br>
I really don't mind what happens now and then<br>
As long as you'll be my friend at the end<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'm alive and well will you be there a holding my hand?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kryptonite<br>
<br>
You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep<br>
You took for granted all the times I never let you down<br>
You stumbled in and bumped your head if not for me then you'd be dead<br>
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground<br>

Last night a little dancer came dancin to my door<br>
Last night a little angel came pumpin cross my floor<br>
She said come on baby I got a license for love<br>
And if it expires pray help from above<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midnight hour she cried "more, more, more"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a rebel yell...<br>
<br>
She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg<br>
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed<br>
What set you free and brought you to be me babe<br>
What set you free I need you hear by me Because<br>

You gotta keep 'em separated<br>
<br>
Like the latest fashion<br>
Like a spreading disease<br>
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom<br>
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease<br>
The gangs stake out their own campus locale<br>
And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal<br>
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix<br>
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, man, you talkin' back to me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take him out (you gotta keep 'em separated)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, man, you disrespecting me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take him out (you gotta keep 'em separated)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, they don't pay no mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, come out and play<br>
<br>
By the time you hear the siren<br>
It's already too late<br>
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail<br>
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste<br>
It goes down the same as the thousand before<br>
No one's getting smarter, no one's learning the score<br>
Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate<br>
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own...<br>

If you're havin trouble with the high school head he's givin you the blues<br>
You wanna graduate but not in his bed, here's what you gotta do<br>
Pick up the phone I'm always home call me any time<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap x 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap x 2<br>

You've got problems in your life of love, you got a broken heart<br>
He's double dealin with your best friend, that's when the teardrops start fella<br>
Pick up the phone I'm here alone, I'll make a social call<br>
Come right in forget 'bout him we'll have ourselves a ball<br>

If you got a lady and you want her gone but you ain't got the guts<br>

For a fee I'm happy to be your back door man hey<br>

<button class='accordion'>18. Play That Funky Music</button>
<div class='panel'>
Hey, do it now<br>
<br>
Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>

<br>
Crazy, but that's how it goes, millions of people living as foes<br>
Maybe, it's not too late, to learn how to love, and forget how to hate<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds not healing life's a bitter shame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm goin off the rails on a crazy train<br>
<br>
I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules<br>
One person conditioned to rule and control, the media sells it and you live the role<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds still screaming driving me insane...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that things are going wrong for me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gotta listen to my words, yeah<br>
<br>
Solo<br>
<br>
Heirs of a cold war that's what we've become, inheriting troubles I'm mentally numb<br>
Crazy, I just cannot bear I'm living with something that just isn't fair<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental wounds not healing, who and what's to blame...<br>

I was cuttin' the rug down at a place called 'The Jug' with a girl named Linda Lou<br>
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand, he was looking for you know who.<br>
He said "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow, watcha tryin to prove?<br>
Cuz thats my woman there and I'm a man who cares and this might be all for you"<br>
(I said "excuse me!")<br>
<br>
I was scared and fearing for my life,I was shaking like a leaf on a tree<br>
Cuz he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord, a pointing that gun at me<br>
"Oh wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her, don't want no trouble with you<br>
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me ask one favor from you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, won't you gimme three steps .. mister .. toward the door?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gimme three steps .. mister and you'll never see me no more. For sure<br>
<br>
Oh, well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray and the water fell on the floor.<br>
And I'm telling you, son, well it ain't no fun, staring straight down a forty-four.<br>
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou, and that's the break I was looking for<br>
and you could hear me screaming a mile away as I was headed out toward the door.<br>

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean<br>
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen<br>
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies<br>
Knockin' me out with those American thighs<br>
<br>
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,<br>
She told me to come, but I was already there<br>
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shook me all night long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you shook me all night long<br>
<br>
Working double time on the seduction line<br>
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine<br>
Wanted no applause, just another course<br>
Made a meal out of me and come back for more<br>
<br>
Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,<br>
Now I'm back in the ring to take a-nother swing<br>
Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking<br>
My mind was aching, and we were making it<br>

My girlfriend's a dick magnet my girlfriend gotta have it<br>
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage doing shotsTip the man, he'll ring the bell get her drunk she'll scream like hell<br>
Dirty girl, getting down, dance with guys from outta town<br>
Grab her ass, acting tough, mess with her, she'll fuck you up<br>
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned but she's coming back to my place tonight<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what she is no doubt about it she's a bad, bad girlfriend<br>
<br>
Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along<br>
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't take her long to make things right<br>

She's got a smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky<br>
Now and then when I see her face she takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa sweet child of mine / love of mine<br>
<br>
She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and rain to quietly pass me by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa...<br>

Where do we go..<br>
