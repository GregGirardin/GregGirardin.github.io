I don't care if Monday's blue, Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too<br>
Thursday I don't care about you it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
Monday you can fall apart, Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart<br>
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start, it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday wait, and Sunday always comes too late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Friday never hesitate<br>
<br>
I don't care if Monday's black, Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack<br>
Thursday never looking back it's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Monday you can hold your head Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed<br>
Or Thursday watch the walls instead It's Friday, I'm in love<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday wait..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed up to the eyes it's a wonderful surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see your shoes and your spirits rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as sleek as a shriek spinning 'round and 'round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always take a big bite it's such a gorgeous sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see you eat in the middle of the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can never get enough, enough of this stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Friday, I'm in love<br>

Well, she was an American girl raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>
And if she had to die tryin she had one little promise she was gonna keep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

I was on the outside when you said, you said you needed me<br>
I was looking at myself, I was blind, I could not see<br>
<br>
A boy tries hard to be a man his mother takes him by his hand<br>
If he stops to think he starts to cry, oh, why?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you walk away, walk away walk away, walk away, I will follow x 2<br>

I was on the inside when they pulled the four walls down<br>
I was looking through the window, I was lost, I am found<br>

<button class='accordion'>5. One Thing Leads To Another</button>
<div class='panel'>
The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>
You've got a blank face, which irritates, communicate pull out your party piece<br>
You see dimensions, in two, state your case with black or white<br>
But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Break * (vocal comes in near the end of the break)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing, one thing leads to another..<br>
<br>
Then it's easy to believe, somebody's been lying to me<br>
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans<br>
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood<br>
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
Who never ever learned to read or write so well<br>
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, go.. go Johnny, go, go Johnny B. Goode<br>
<br>
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track<br>
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade<br>
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made<br>
The people passing by they would stop and say<br>
"Oh my what that little country boy could play"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
His mother told him "someday you will be a man<br>
And you will be the leader of a big old band<br>
Many people coming from miles around<br>
To hear you play your music when the sun go down<br>
Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>

When in walked a man with a gun in his hand, he was looking for you know who.<br>
He said "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow, watcha tryin to prove?<br>
Cuz thats my woman there and I'm a man who cares and this might be all for you"<br>
(I said "excuse me!")<br>

I was scared and fearing for my life,I was shaking like a leaf on a tree<br>
Cuz he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord, a pointing that gun at me<br>
"Oh wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her, don't want no trouble with you<br>
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me ask one favor from you<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, won't you gimme three steps .. mister .. toward the door?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gimme three steps .. mister and you'll never see me no more. For sure<br>

Oh, well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray and the water fell on the floor.<br>
And I'm telling you, son, well it ain't no fun, staring straight down a forty-four.<br>

and you could hear me screaming a mile away as I was headed out toward the door.<br>

<div class='panel'>
Hey, do it now<br>
<br>
Hey, once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock n roll band<br>
I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands<br>
And everything around me got to stop to feelin so low<br>
And I decided quickly yes, I did, to disco down and check out the show<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah they were dancin and singin and movin to the groovin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play that funky music, white boy / right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die<br>
<br>
I tried to understand this I thought that they were outta their minds<br>
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind<br>
So still I kept on fighting losing every step by the way<br>
I said, I must go back there, I got to go back and check to see if things still the same<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus / Solo<br>
<br>
Now first it wasn't easy changing rock 'n' roll at minds<br>
And things were gettin' shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind<br>
Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>

She was pure like snowflakes, no one could ever stain<br>
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Years go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;My angel is the centerfold, angel is the centerfold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold<br>
<br>
Slipped me notes under the desk while I was thinkin' about her dress<br>
I was shy, I turned away before she caught my eye<br>
I was shakin' in my shoes whenever she flashed those baby-blues<br>
Something had a hold on me when angel passed close by<br>

We'll take it to a motel room and take 'em off in private<br>

You've burned your breakfast so far, things are goin great<br>
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these<br>
Oh, but she didn't tell you when the world has brought<br>
You down to your knees that<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems you're the only one who knows, what it's like to be me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone I'll always laugh with, even at my worst I'm best with you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SOLO<br>
<br>
It's like you're always stuck in second gear..<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll be there for you x 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause you're there for me too<br>

<div class='panel'>
Don't you know what you're doing, you've got a death wish<br>
<br>
Suicide blonde (repeat)<br>
<br>
Suicide blonde was the color of her hair<br>
Like a cheap distraction for a new affair<br>
She knew it would finish before it began<br>
Wow baby I think you lost the plan<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to make her suicide blonde<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love devastation, suicide blonde (x 2)<br>
<br>
She stripped to the beat but her clothes stay on<br>
White light everywhere but you can't see a thing<br>
Such a squeeze a mad sad moment<br>
Glory to you, glory to you<br>
Take me there, take me there<br>
<br>
Got some revelation put into your hands<br>
Save you from your misery like rain across the land<br>
Don't you see the color of deception<br>
Turning your world around again<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to make... her suicide blonde<br>
<br>
That's the story<br>

Crack that whip, give the past a slip<br>
Step on a crack, break your mama's back<br>
<br>
When a problem comes along, you must whip it<br>
Before the cream sits out too long, you must whip it<br>
When something's going wrong, you must whip it<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now whip it, into shape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape it up, get straight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go forward, move ahead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to detect it, it's not too late<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To whip it, whip it good<br>
<br>
When a good time turns around, you must whip it<br>
You will never live it down, unless you whip it<br>
No one gets away, until they whip it<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I say whip it, whip it good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I say whip it, whip it good<br>
<br>
Crack that whip...<br>
When a problem comes along...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now whip it, into shape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape it up, get straight<br>

The one that makes me laugh she said, threw her arms around my neck<br>
Show me how you do it, and I promise you I promise that I'll run away with you<br>
I'll run away with you<br>
<br>
Spinning on that dizzy edge I kissed her face and kissed her head<br>
Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow<br>
Why are you so far away? she said why won't you ever know<br>
That I'm in love with you. That I'm in love with you.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You, soft and only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, lost and lonely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, strange as angels<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dancing in the deepest oceans wwisting in the water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You're just like a dream, just like a dream<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo<br>
<br>
Daylight licked me into shape I must have been asleep for days<br>
And moving lips to breathe her name I opened up my eyes<br>
And found myself alone alone alone above a raging sea<br>
That stole the only girl I loved and drowned her deep inside of me<br>

In every breath and every word<br>
I hear your name calling me out<br>
