<button class='accordion'>1. Cheap Sunglasses</button>
<div class='panel'>
When you wake up in the morning and the light has hurt your head<br>
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed<br>
Is hit the streets a-runnin' and try to beat the masses<br>
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
Spied a little thing and I followed her all night<br>
In a funky fine Levi's and her sweater's kind of tight<br>
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molasses<br>
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
Now go out and get yourself some big black frames<br>
With the glass so dark they won't even know your name<br>
And the choice is up to you 'cause they come in two classes<br>
Rhinestone shades or cheap sunglasses<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah!<br>
<br>

No matter what you do I will always be around<br>
Won't you tell me what you found girl, ooh girl, want you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knock down the old grey wall, be a part of it all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would give me all, as I would give it to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be<br>

No matter where you go there will always be a place<br>

<div class='panel'>
Run and tell all of the angels this could take all night<br>
Think I need a devil to help me get things right<br>
Hook me up a new revolution cause this one is a lie<br>
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I'm looking to the sky to save me looking for a sign of life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for something to help me burn out bright<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm looking for a complication looking cause I'm tired of lying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make my way back home when I learn to fly high<br>
<br>
I think I'm done nursing the patience it can wait one night<br>
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try<br>
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life<br>
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to make this life my own (repeat)<br>

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>

Black and orange stray cat sittin' on a fence<br>
I ain't got enough dough to pay the rent<br>
I'm flat broke but I don't care<br>
I strut right by with my tail in the air<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stray cat strut, I'm a ladies cat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a feline Casanova, hey man that's that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a shoe thrown at me from a mean old man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get my dinner from a garbage can<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't bother chasing mice around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slink down the alleyway looking for a fight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howling to the moonlight on a hot summer night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singin the blues while the lady cats cry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wild stray cat, you're a real gone guy"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I could be as carefree and wild<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I got cat class and I got cat style<br>

Take the last train to Clarksville and I'll meet you at the station<br>
You can be here by 4:30 cause I've made your reservation<br>
Don't be slow oh, no, no, no<br>

Cause I'm leavin' in the morning and I must see you again<br>
We'll have one more night together til the morning brings my train<br>
And I must go, oh, no, no, no<br>
<br>
 And I don't know if I'm ever coming home<br>
<br>
Take the last train to Clarksville I'll be waiting at the station<br>
We'll have time for coffee flavored kisses and a bit of conversation<br>
Oh, no, no, no<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;do do do...<br>
<br>
Take the last train to Clarksville now I must hang up the phone<br>
I can't hear you in this noisy railroad station all alone<br>
I'm feelin' low oh, no, no, no<br>

 And I don't know if I'm ever coming home<br>

Won't you come see about me? I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby<br>
Tell me your troubles and doubts giving me everything inside and out and<br>
Love's strange so real in the dark think of the tender things that we were working on<br>
Slow change may pull us apart when the light gets into your heart, baby<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you forget about me<br>

I was cuttin' the rug down at a place called 'The Jug' with a girl named Linda Lou<br>
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand, he was looking for you know who.<br>
He said "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow, watcha tryin to prove?<br>
Cuz thats my woman there and I'm a man who cares and this might be all for you"<br>
(I said "excuse me!")<br>
<br>
I was scared and fearing for my life,I was shaking like a leaf on a tree<br>
Cuz he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord, a pointing that gun at me<br>
"Oh wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her, don't want no trouble with you<br>
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me ask one favor from you<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, won't you gimme three steps .. mister .. toward the door?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gimme three steps .. mister and you'll never see me no more. For sure<br>
<br>
Oh, well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray and the water fell on the floor.<br>
And I'm telling you, son, well it ain't no fun, staring straight down a forty-four.<br>
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou, and that's the break I was looking for<br>
and you could hear me screaming a mile away as I was headed out toward the door.<br>

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans<br>
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood<br>
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
Who never ever learned to read or write so well<br>
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, go.. go Johnny, go, go Johnny B. Goode<br>
<br>
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track<br>
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade<br>
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made<br>
The people passing by they would stop and say<br>
"Oh my what that little country boy could play"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus<br>
<br>
His mother told him "someday you will be a man<br>
And you will be the leader of a big old band<br>
Many people coming from miles around<br>
To hear you play your music when the sun go down<br>
Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>

Well, she was an American girl raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else<br>
After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to<br>
And if she had to die tryin she had one little promise she was gonna keep<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O yeah, all right take it easy, baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it last all night she was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say<br>

But when one little cross leads to shots grit your teeth<br>
You run for cover so discreet why don't they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what they say, say what you mean, one thing leads to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You told me something wrong I know I listen too long but then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing leads to another<br>
<br>
The impression that you sell, passes in and out like a scent<br>
But the long face that you see, comes from living close to your fears<br>
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight, you've seen your name on the walls<br>
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat<br>
You run for cover and there's heat why don't they<br>

But when the wrong word goes in the right ear, I know you've been lying to me<br>
It's getting rough off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough, bigger the harder he falls<br>
But when the wrong antidote is like a bone in the throat<br>
You run for cover in the heat why don't they<br>
